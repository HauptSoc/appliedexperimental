Welcome!

In this week's coursework we are going to start exploring statistical
methods---linear regression. We will start with the "basic" case or simple
linear regression, with a single quantitative explanatory variable and a
quantitative response. We will review the concepts behind linear regression,
learn how to visualize regression models, and practice obtaining the estimated
regression lines in `R`.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

-   describe the difference between explanatory and predictive modeling
-   produce data visualizations for a simple linear regression
-   describe how `R` decides on the "best" regression line
-   fit a simple linear regression in `R`
-   write out an estimated regression line
-   interpret the slope of an estimated regression line
-   interpret the intercept of an estimated regression line
-   describe what an "offset" is in a simple linear regression
-   interpret the offsets of an estimated regression line
-   calculate a residual for an observation

Don't worry about Section 5.3.3, it goes a bit too in the weeds for what we are interested in.

## Concept Quiz -- Due Monday by the start of class

**1. What does the correlation coefficient measure?**

-   strength of a relationship between two variables
-   strength of a linear relationship between two variables
-   strength of a relationship between two numerical variables
-   strength of a linear relationship between two numerical variables

**2. How do you interpret a slope coefficient?**

-   For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$
-   For any increase of $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean of $y$
-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in $y$
-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the slope is the expected increase in the mean of $y$

**3. How do you interpret an intercept coefficient?**

-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in $y$
-   For a 1-unit increase in $x$, the intercept is the expected increase in the mean of $y$
-   For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of $y$
-   For an $x$ value of 0, the intercept is the expected value of the mean of $y$

**4. Match the *explanatory* and *response* variables to the correct variables in the `lm()` function syntax.**

`lm(variable1 ~ variable2, data = <NAME OF DATASET>)`

**5. What `geom_` adds a linear regression line to a scatterplot?**

-   `geom_line()`
-   `geom_smoother()`
-   `geom_regression()`
-   `geom_smooth()`
