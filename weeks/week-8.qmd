# Concept Quiz -- Due Tuesday by noon

**1. Which of the following are _always_ true for hypothesis statements?**

- They are about sample statistics.
- They are about relationships between variables.
- They are about population parameters.
- They are about differences in groups.

**2. Which of the following are true about a null distribution?** (select all that apply)

- It is a distribution of statistics.
- The values on the distribution represent what might have happened if the null hypothesis was true.
- The values on the distribution represent what might have happened if the alternative hypothesis was true.
- It is a distribution of samples.

**3. Which of the following are true about a p-value?** (select all that apply)

- It is calculated assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- It is the probability the null hypothesis is true.
- It quantifies how "surprising" our data are.
- It compares the observed statistic to a distribution of values that could have happened if the null was true.
- It is calculated assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.
- It is a probability.


**4. Which of the following is true about a small p-value?**

- The sample statistic is unlikely to have happened by chance.
- The sample size was large.
- The sample statistic is unlikely to have happened if the null hypothesis was true.
- The sample statistic was large.

**5. If you obtain a large p-value, what can you conclude about your hypotheses?**

- We cannot say the alternative hypothesis is false.
- We cannot say the null hypothesis is false.
- The null hypothesis is true.
- The alternative hypothesis is true.

**6. Match each procedure to the question it addresses.**

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
confidence intervals

::: {.column width="55%"}
- What are plausible values for the population parameter?
- What are plausible values for the sample statistic?
- Is the population parameter different from 0?
- Is the value of the parameter different from a specified quantity?

**7. If the probability of a Type I error goes down, what can you say about the probability of a Type II error?** 

- The probability of a Type II error goes down.
- The probability of a Type II error stays the same.
- The probability of a Type II error goes up.


**8. If you obtained a small p-value (e.g., 0.02), what could you say about your confidence interval?** 

- It would contain the null hypothesized value.
- It would not contain the null hypothesized value.
- It would contain the sample statistic.
- It would contain the true population parameter.

**9. In a regression table, what is the "statistic" value associated with the slope?** 

- a bootstrap statistic
- a z-statistic
- the sample slope statistic
- a t-statistic

**10. In a regression table, how is the p-value calculated?** 

- Using a permutation distribution with 1000 resamples
- Using a bootstrap distribution with 1000 samples
- Using a Normal distribution
- Using a t-distribution

**11. What are the required conditions for linear regression?** (select all that apply)

- a random sample was taken
- equal variance of residuals
- a large sample was collected
- linear relationship between x and y
- independence of observations
- independence of variables
- normality of residuals
- normality of observations

**12. Which of the following would violate the condition of independence?** (select all that apply)

- collecting a non-random sample
- observations related geographically (spatially)
- observations that are related in time (temporally)
- repeated observations on the same person
- observations related biologically
