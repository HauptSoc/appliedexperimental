# Concept Quiz -- Due Monday by the start of class

**1. What are the required conditions for linear regression?** (select all that apply)

-   a random sample was taken
-   equal variance of residuals
-   a large sample was collected
-   linear relationship between x and y
-   independence of observations
-   independence of variables
-   normality of residuals
-   normality of observations

**2. In the scatterplot of stem dry mass versus stem length, what condition appears to be violated?** (select all that apply)

-   equal variance of residuals
-   linear relationship between x and y
-   independence of observations
-   normality of residuals

**3. Which of the following would violate the condition of independence?** (select all that apply)

-   collecting a non-random sample
-   observations related geographically (spatially)
-   observations that are related in time (temporally)
-   repeated observations on the same person
-   observations related biologically

**4. When conducting a hypothesis test (in general), we assume the \[observations / variables\] are independent. When conducting a hypothesis test for a linear regression, the conditions require that the \[observations / variables\] are independent.**
