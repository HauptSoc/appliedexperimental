<!-- Add Study Design Chapter from IMS to this week! -->

<!-- By the end of this coursework you should be able to: -->

<!-- -   delineate the difference between a population and a sample -->

<!-- -   compare and contrast different sampling methods -->

<!-- -   outline what is necessary to make an experiment an "experiment" -->

<!-- -   characterize the differences between observational studies and experiments -->

<!-- [**Required Tutorial:** Sampling Strategies & Experimental Design](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-03/#section-sampling-in-r) -->

**3. Which of the following statements are true about observational studies and experiments? Select all that apply!**

-   Experiments randomly assign the explanatory variable
-   Observational studies randomly assign the explanatory variable
-   Observational studies can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables
-   Experiments can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables

**4. What are different methods for sampling from a population? Select all that apply!**

-   simple random sampling
-   stratified random sampling
-   cluster sampling
-   multistage sampling
-   convenience sampling

**5. Cluster sampling and stratified sampling both rely on grouping observations, but have important differences. Match each method to how observations are randomly sampled.**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
**stratified sampling**

**cluster sampling**
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
*groups of observations are created, groups are randomly selected, every observation in the selected group is sampled*

*groups of observations are created, observations within a group are randomly sampled*

**2. To create a 95% confidence interval using the percentile method, what percentiles of the bootstrap distribution do you need to calculate?**

-   0th
-   2.5th
-   5th
-   90th
-   95th
-   97.5th

**3. To create a 95% confidence interval using the standard error method, what standard error do you use?**

-   the sample standard deviation
-   the bootstrap distribution standard deviation
-   a resample standard deviation
-   1.96

**4. We almost never know if our confidence interval captured the true population parameter.**

-   True
-   False

**5. What percentage of 99% confidence intervals do you expect to capture the true population parameter?**

**6. The word "confident" in a confidence interval interpretation corresponds to what aspect of the interval?**

-   the accuracy of the original sample
-   the reliability of the procedure for constructing confidence intervals
-   the precision of the bootstrap samples

**7. Which of the following are true?**

-   Smaller sample sizes tend to produce narrower confidence intervals.
-   Smaller sample sizes tend to produce wider confidence intervals.
-   Lower confidence levels tend to produce wider confidence intervals.
-   Lower confidence levels tend to produce narrower confidence intervals.

**8. In a regression table, what does the "std_error" value associated with the slope represent?**

-   the standard deviation of the sample
-   the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution
-   the estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution
-   the standard error of the sample

**9. In a regression table, how is the "std_error" value calculated?**

-   a mathematical formula
-   the standard deviation of the sample
-   the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution

**10. What percentage confidence interval is output in a regression table?**

-   99%
-   95%
-   90%
