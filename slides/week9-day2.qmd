# Lab 8 Recap

## Common Mistakes

</br>

:::{.small}
**Questions 1 & 2** -- Your axis labels should contain units and indicate if your variables were transformed! 

</br>

:::{.fragment}
**Question 6** -- Equal variance is not about equal points above and below the line! 
:::

</br>

:::{.fragment}
**Question 11** -- Your hypothesis test decision should state what $\alpha$ was used!
:::

</br>

:::{.fragment}
**Question 14** -- The $t$-distribution *approximates* the permutation distribution!
:::

</br>

:::{.fragment}
**Question 15** -- Both theory-based and simulation-based methods have conditions and the reliability of a p-value depends on those conditions.

# Coding a One-way ANOVA

## Visualizations -- Density Ridges

```{r}
#| label: density-ridge-template
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(data = <NAME OF DATASET>, 
       mapping = aes(x = <NAME OF NUMERICAL VARIABLE>, 
                     y = <NAME OF CATEGORICAL VARIABLE>)
       ) + 
  geom_density_ridges()+
  labs(x = "<TITLE FOR THE X-AXIS>", 
       y = "<TITLE FOR THE Y-AXIS>")
```

## Choosing a Statistical Model

</br>

Everyone will fit **two** one-way ANOVA models --- one model for each explanatory variable!

:::{.incremental}
:::{.small}
- You will need to choose whether to use a theory-based method or a simulation-based method. 
- Your choice is based on the model conditions --- specifically the normality condition. 
  * The density ridge plots can be used to check the normality and equal variance conditions. 
  * The study design should be used to check the independence condition. 
:::
:::

## Theory-based Method

</br>

To fit a theory-based ANOVA, you use the following code:

```{r}
#| label: owa-template
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

my_model <- aov(<NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE> ~ <NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE>, 
                data = <NAME OF DATASET>)
```

</br>

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
# Only use if normality is not violated!

If you look at your density ridge plots and you believe the normality condition is violated, you **should not** use a theory-based method! 
:::

## Simulation-based Method

:::{.small}
To fit a simulation-based ANOVA, you need to carry out the following steps:

1. find the observed statistic
2. simulate statistics that could have happened if the null was true
3. visualize the distribution of simulated statistics (your permutation distribution)
4. calculate the p-value for your observed statistic
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
# 2 levels versus 3 levels

If you categorical variable has **two** levels, you need to use a `"diff in means"` statistic, **not** an F-statistic!
:::

## Model Validity

You can assess the normality and equal variance conditions based on the density ridge plots you make!

# Where are we headed next week? 

## Two-way ANOVA

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: age-two-cat

ggplot(data = evals_small, 
       mapping = aes(y = age_cat, x = min_eval, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PRGn") +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Gaps between male and female faculty evaluation scores become more pronounced with age", 
       x = "", 
       fill = "Professor's Sex") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 24), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 16), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Code for Plot

```{r}
#| label: density-ridge-code
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

ggplot(data = evals_small, 
       mapping = aes(y = age_cat, x = min_eval, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PRGn") +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Gaps between male and female faculty evaluation scores become more pronounced with age", 
       x = "", 
       fill = "Professor's Sex") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
# Legend Positions

:::{.small}
There are four options for `legend.position` 

1. `"none"` (removes the legend)
2. `"left"` (difficult to read with the y-axis label)
3. `"right"` (the default position)
4. `"bottom"` (difficult to read with the x-axis label)
5. `"top"` (generally my preference)
