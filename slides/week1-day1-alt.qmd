What is Statistics?
:::

. . .

> Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations -- collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments -- form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data.

Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.

![The data science cycle -- Wickham & Grolemund](images/cycle.png){fig-alt="A figure of the 'data science cycle', with six different stages. The process starts with 'Import' (importing a dataset), then moves to 'Tidy' (tidying the dataset you imported). From there, the diagram has a blue box labeled the 'Explore' cycle, which includes the 'Transform', 'Visualize,' and 'Model' stages. These stages are connected in a circle with arrows between each stage, implying that these stages are a cycle which one can repeat. After the 'Explore' cycle, there in one additional stage labeled 'Communicate,' representing how you communicate the results of your analysis."}

-   work with data in a reproducible way (using R)
-   visualize and summarize a variety of datasets (in R)
