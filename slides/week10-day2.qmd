## Advice on Poster Formatting

::: {.midi}
You will likely need to cut down some of the content from your report to fit 
on your poster! 

For people to be able to read your poster, your font size ***should not be any smaller than 24pt.***
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
- You are expected to include **all** the required components in your poster.
  * To fit everything, your writing needs to be clear and concise. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
# Getting Help from Generative AI

Humans tend to be very wordy in their writing, so this might be a good place 
to ask Generative AI for some help making your writing more concise. 

Be sure to read the suggested edits so nothing important gets cut!
:::
:::

## More Advice 

- I don't need to see statements of hypotheses (e.g., $H_0$ or $H_A$)
  * I can infer what your null and alternative hypotheses were based on your 
  conclusions!

. . .

- Please don't use the s-word (significance). ðŸ˜±
  * Provide a more descriptive summary of your findings!

# Structure of Final Projects

## Hypothesis Test Conclusions

> Conclusions should be written in terms of the alternative hypothesis

</br>

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Did you reject the null hypothesis?**

Then you have evidence that at least one group has a different mean!
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Did you fail to reject the null hypothesis?**

Then you have [insufficient evidence](https://critical-inference.com/the-problem-with-no-evidence-and-is-it-enough-to-bust-a-myth/) that at least one group has a different mean!

## Discussion

::: {.midi}
> Describe whether you believe the tests you performed are "reliable.
:::

::: small
-   Independence
    -   *within* groups
    -   *between* groups
-   Normality of the distributions for each group
-   Equal variance of the distributions for each group
:::

::: callout-caution
# Conditions for Each Test

Each one-way ANOVA test considers different groups. So, your conditions should be evaluated for each test separately.
:::

## [Conditions are never met!](https://critical-inference.com/assumptions-are-not-met-period/)

$H_0$: the condition is met

$H_A$: the condition is violated

</br>

. . .

Just like we never say "I accept the null hypothesis," we never say a condition is "met." Instead, we say there is no evidence that the condition is violated.

# Remedying Condition Violations

## Is independence violated?

::: {.small}
You should have only **one** observation per observational unit (e.g., fish, 
salamander, teacher).

`and_vertebrates`

vertebrates_small <- and_vertebrates %>%
  group_by(pitnumber) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```
:::

OR

## Do you have really skewed data?

```{r channel-}

  ggplot(aes(y = unittype, x = weight_g)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +

        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18))

# Work Sesssion

## Order of Priorities

1. Fix your code (if needed)

2. Copy content over to your poster

3. Modify the original content based on Dr. Theobold's feedback

# Assistance from Dr. Theobold

My priority is helping students who need to repair their code for their 
analysis. Once everyone has been helped, I'm happy to answer additional 
questions.

<!-- # Some Closing Thoughts... -->

<!-- ## I hope you leave this class understanding... -->

<!-- -   Reproducibility is a foundational aspect to scientific research. -->

<!-- -   Data visualizations tell you a story, where statistical tests only tell you a summary. -->

<!-- -   Multiple regression and ANOVA are powerful tools to explore multivariate relationships. -->

<!-- -   A well thought out study is more powerful than any statistical analysis. -->

<!-- ## The Discipline of Statistics -->

<!-- The field of Statistics was developed to evaluate evidence obtained from data. Over the last century, the use of statistics has become embedded as a component of the scientific process for many disciplines. -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- ::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"} -->
<!-- > "I advocate a simple solution: Replace the s-word with words describing what you actually mean by it." -->

<!-- ## Foundational ideas taught in statistics courses were invented by: -->

<!-- -   Karl Pearson -->
<!-- -   Ronald Fisher -->

<!-- **Eugenics & Statistics** -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"} -->

<!-- > *Ideally, statisticians would like to divorce these tools from the lives and times of the people who created them. It would be convenient if statistics existed outside of history, but that's not the case. Statistics, as a lens through which scientists investigate real-world questions, has always been smudged by the fingerprints of the people holding the lens. Statistical thinking and eugenicist thinking are, in fact, deeply intertwined, and many of the theoretical problems with methods like significance testing---first developed to identify racial differences---are remnants of their original purpose, to support eugenics.* -->
