## Hypothesis Test Conclusions

> Conclusions should be written in terms of the alternative hypothesis

</br>

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Did you reject the null hypothesis?**

Then you have evidence that at least one group has a different mean!
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Did you fail to reject the null hypothesis?**

Then you have [insufficient evidence](https://critical-inference.com/the-problem-with-no-evidence-and-is-it-enough-to-bust-a-myth/) that at least one group has a different mean!

-   Independence
    -   *within* groups

# Conditions for Each Test

Each one-way ANOVA test considers different groups. So, your conditions should be evaluated for each test separately.
:::

## [Conditions are never met!](https://critical-inference.com/assumptions-are-not-met-period/)

$H_0$: the condition is met

$H_A$: the condition is violated

</br>

. . .

Just like we never say "I accept the null hypothesis," we never say a condition is "met." Instead, we say there is no evidence that the condition is violated.

## Study Limitations

This section summarizes your understanding of the foundational aspects of experimental design.

:::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: small
> Based on the sampling method used, what larger population can you infer the results or your analysis onto?

-   What were the inclusion criteria of the observations?
-   How does that influence the population you can infer your findings onto?

> Based on the design of the study, what type of statements can be made about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables?

## Overall Conclusions

# Remedying Condition Violations

## Do you have multiple observations that are related?

You should have only **one** observation per observational unit (e.g., fish, 
salamander, teacher). 

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
`and_vertebrates`

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| label: independence-vertebrates
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

vertebrates_small <- and_vertebrates %>%
  group_by(pitnumber) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

`evals`

```{r}

#| code-line-numbers: false

evals_small <- evals %>% 
  group_by(prof_ID) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```
:::

OR 

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| label: independence-evals-2
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

evals_small <- evals %>% 
  group_by(prof_ID) %>% 
  mutate(min_score = min(score)) %>%
  distinct(prof_ID, 
           .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```
:::
:::

## Do you have really skewed data?

```{r channel-}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

trout %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = unittype, x = weight_g)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  labs(y = "Channel Type", 
       x = "Weight (g)") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18))
```

## Try using a log transformation!

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Un-transformed Variances**

```{r variance-table}
#| echo: false

trout %>% 
  drop_na(weight_g) %>% 
  group_by(unittype) %>% 
  summarize(var = var(weight_g)) %>% 
  gt()

# Final Poster Presentations

## Presentation Structure

Each section will have an 80-minute poster presentation session. 

- Section 01: 10:10am to 11:30am 
- Section 02: 11:40am to 1:00pm

. . .

</br> 

Bring your laptop so you can plug into the monitor to display your poster. There
are no computers in the presentation room!

# Some Closing Thoughts...

## I hope you leave this class understanding...

-   Reproducibility is a foundational aspect to scientific research.

-   Data visualizations tell you a story, where statistical tests only tell you a summary.

-   Multiple regression and ANOVA are powerful tools to explore multivariate relationships.

-   A well thought out study is more powerful than any statistical analysis.

## The Discipline of Statistics

The field of Statistics was developed to evaluate evidence obtained from data. Over the last century, the use of statistics has become embedded as a component of the scientific process for many disciplines.

<!-- > *Ideally, statisticians would like to divorce these tools from the lives and times of the people who created them. It would be convenient if statistics existed outside of history, but that's not the case. Statistics, as a lens through which scientists investigate real-world questions, has always been smudged by the fingerprints of the people holding the lens. Statistical thinking and eugenicist thinking are, in fact, deeply intertwined, and many of the theoretical problems with methods like significance testing---first developed to identify racial differences---are remnants of their original purpose, to support eugenics.* -->
