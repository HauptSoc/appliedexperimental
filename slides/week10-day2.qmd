  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +

I hope you leave this class understanding...

-   Reproducibility is a foundational aspect to scientific research.

-   Data visualizations tell you a story, where statistical tests only tell you a summary.

-   Multiple regression and ANOVA are powerful tools to explore multivariate relationships.

-   A well thought out study is more powerful than any statistical analysis.

The Discipline of Statistics
:::

> The field of Statistics was developed to evaluate evidence obtained from data. Over the last century, the use of statistics has become embedded as a component of the scientific process for many disciplines.

**Foundational ideas taught in statistics courses were invented by:**

-   Francis Galton
-   Karl Pearson

**Eugenics & Statistics**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
> *Ideally, statisticians would like to divorce these tools from the lives and times of the people who created them. It would be convenient if statistics existed outside of history, but that's not the case. Statistics, as a lens through which scientists investigate real-world questions, has always been smudged by the fingerprints of the people holding the lens. Statistical thinking and eugenicist thinking are, in fact, deeply intertwined, and many of the theoretical problems with methods like significance testing---first developed to identify racial differences---are remnants of their original purpose, to support eugenics.*
