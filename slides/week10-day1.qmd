## What are we looking for?

```{r}
#| label: twa-plot-year

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = year_cat, x = stem_dry_mass, fill = watershed)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Sugar Maples Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Another way to think about it...

```{r}
#| label: twa-facet-maples
#| echo: false

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = year_cat, x = stem_dry_mass)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ watershed) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Sugar Maples Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

# Interaction Two-way ANOVA

## Research Question

> Does the relationship between stem dry mass and calcium treatment for sugar maples differ based on the year the treatment was applied?

. . .

</br>

Or, because the study was an experiment...

> Does the effect of calcium treatment on the stem dry mass of sugar maples differ based on the year of the treatment?

## Conditions

-   Independence of observations

::: small
> Observations are independent *within* groups **and** *between* groups
:::

. . .

-   Equal variability of the groups

::: small
> The spread of the distributions are similar across groups
:::

. . .

-   Normality of the residuals

::: small
> The distribution of residuals for each group is approximately normal
:::

## Theory-based Two-Way ANOVA

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: twa-interaction-code
#| code-line-numbers: false

aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed * year_cat, 
    data = hbr_maples_small)
```

</br>

```{r}
#| label: twa-interaction-table

aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed * year_cat, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

. . .

::: small
The `watershed:year_cat` line is testing if the relationship between the calcium treatment (`watershed`) and stem dry mass differs between 2003 and 2004.
:::

. . .

</br>

<center>Does it?</center>

## How are those p-values calculated?

The p-values in the previous table use **Type I** sums of squares.

> Type I sums of squares are "sequential," meaning variables are tested in the order they are listed.

. . .

</br>

So, the p-value for `watershed:year_cat` is **conditional** on including `watershed` and `year_cat` as explanatory variables.

. . .

</br>

Is that what we want????

## Testing "main effects"

If there is evidence of an interaction, we **do not** test if the main effects are "significant."

. . .

</br>

Why?

. . .

</br>

The interactions depend on these variables, so they should be included in the model!

## Interpreting "main effects"

When interaction effects are present, the interpretation of the main effects is incomplete or misleading

::: center
![](images/car-interaction.png)
:::

# Additive Two-way ANOVA

## What if our analysis found no evidence of an interaction?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: twa-plot-watershed
#| fig-align: center

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  drop_na(elevation) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = elevation, x = stem_dry_mass, fill = watershed)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Stem Dry Mass Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Testing for a relationship for each variable

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: aov-elevation-first
#| code-line-numbers: false
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ elevation + watershed, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy()
```

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ elevation + watershed, data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt() 
```

</br>

. . .

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Do you think it matters which variable comes first?
:::

## Let's see...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: aov-watershed-first
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples) %>% 
  tidy()
```

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, data = hbr_maples) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt() 
```

</br>

Did we get the same p-values as before?

## Sequential Versus Partial Sums of Squares

Similar to before, the p-values in the ANOVA table use Type I (sequential) sums of squares.

::: incremental
::: small
-   The p-value for each variable is conditional on the variable(s) that came *before* it.
-   The p-value for `elevation` is conditional on `watershed` being included in the model
-   The p-value for `watershed` is conditional on...nothing.
:::
:::

. . .

::: small
If we want the p-value for each explanatory variable to be conditional on **every** variable included in the model, then we need to use a different type of sums of squares!
:::

## Partial Sums of Squares

> Type III sums of squares are "partial," meaning every term in the model is tested in light of the other terms in the model.

. . .

::: small
-   The p-value for `elevation` is conditional on `watershed` being included in the model
-   The p-value for `watershed` is conditional on `elevation` being included in the model
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip
# Only different for variables that *were not* first

We could have used Type III sums of squares for the interaction model and would have gotten the same p-value!
:::

## Getting the Conditional Tests for Every Variable

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: anova-lm-code
#| code-line-numbers: false

library(car)

water_elev_lm <- lm(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) 

Anova(water_elev_lm, type = "III")
```

::: callout-tip
# Load in the `car` package!
:::

## Additive Model Hypothesis Tests

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: anova-lm-table

water_elev_lm <- lm(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) 

Anova(water_elev_lm, type = "III") %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

</br>

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**What do you think the is the `elevation` line testing?**

::: fragment
**What would you decide?**
:::
:::

## Keeping "Non-significant" Variables

</br>

Should you always remove variables with "large" p-values from an ANOVA?

. . .

</br>

No!

Even "non-significant" variables explain some amount of the variation in the response. Which makes your estimates of a treatment effect more precise!

# Steps for Final Project

## Hypothesis Test Steps

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
Step 1: Fit a one-way ANOVA model for each categorical variable
:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #0F4C81;"}
Step 2: Decide if each explanatory variable has a meaningful relationship with the response variable
:::
:::

::: fragment
-   If yes, then go to Step 3!
-   If no, then report which variable (if any) has the strongest relationship with the response.
:::
:::
:::

## Step 3 -- Fit an Additive Two-way ANOVA

If there is evidence that **both** variables have a relationship with the response variable, then you fit an *additive* two-way ANOVA.

```{r}
#| label: twa-additive-template
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| echo: true

library(car) 

my_model <- lm(<NAME OF RESPONSE VARIABLE> ~ <NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE 1> + <NAME OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLE 2>,
               data = <NAME OF DATASET>) 

Anova(my_model, type = “III”) %>% 
  tidy()

```

::: callout-tip
# Don't forget to load in the `car` package!
:::

## What about interaction models?

</br> </br>

For the sake of time, we **are not** fitting interaction models for the Final Project.

# Do you always expect your main effects to be "significant" in a two-way ANOVA?
