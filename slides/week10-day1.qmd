## Modeling Options

::: columns

Additive Model
:::

::: fragment
Assess if each explanatory variable has a meaningful relationship with the response, conditional on the variable(s) included in the model.

Interaction Model
:::

::: fragment
Assess if the relationship between one categorical explanatory variable and the response **differs** based on the values of another categorical variable.

## What are we looking for?

```{r}
#| label: twa-plot-year

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = year_cat, x = stem_dry_mass, fill = watershed)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Stem Dry Mass Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Another way to think about it...

```{r}
#| label: twa-facet-maples
#| echo: false

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = year_cat, x = stem_dry_mass)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ watershed) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Stem Dry Mass Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

# Interaction Two-way ANOVA

## Research Question

> Does the relationship between stem dry mass and calcium treatment for sugar maples differ based on the year the treatment was applied?

. . .

</br>

Or, because the study was an experiment...

> Does the effect of calcium treatment on the stem dry mass of sugar maples differ based on the year of the treatment? 


## Conditions

-   Independence of observations

:::{.small}
> Observations are independent *within* groups **and** *between* groups
:::

. . .

-   Normality of the residuals

:::{.small}
> The distribution of residuals for each group is approximately normal
:::

. . .

-   Equal variability of the groups

:::{.small}
> The spread of the distributions are similar across groups
:::

## Theory-based Two-Way ANOVA

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: twa-interaction-code

aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed * year_cat, 
    data = hbr_maples_small)
```

</br>

```{r}
#| label: twa-interaction-table

aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed * year_cat, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

. . .

:::{.small}
The `watershed:year_cat` line is testing if the relationship between the calcium treatment (`watershed`) and stem dry mass differs between 2003 and 2004. 
:::

. . .

</br>
<center>
Does it?
</center>

## How are those p-values calculated?

The p-values in the previous table use **Type I** sums of squares. Type I sums of squares are "sequential," meaning variables are tested in the order they are listed. 

. . .

</br>

So, the p-value for `watershed:year_cat` is **conditional** on including `watershed` and `year_cat` as explanatory variables. 

. . .

</br>

Is that what we want????

## Testing "main effects" 

If there is evidence of an interaction, we **do not** test if the main effects are "significant."

. . .

</br>

Why?

. . .

</br>

The interactions depend on these variables, so they should be included in the model!

## Interpreting "main effects" 

When interaction effects are present, the interpretation of the main effects is incomplete or misleading

:::

# Additive Two-way ANOVA

## What if our analysis found no evidence of an interaction?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: twa-plot-watershed
#| fig-align: center

hbr_maples_small %>% 
  drop_na(elevation) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = elevation, x = stem_dry_mass, fill = watershed)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, scale = 1) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = "Effect of Calcium Treatment on Stem Dry Mass Across Different Years",
       x = "Stem Dry Mass (g)", 
       fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Testing for a relationship for each variable

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: aov-elevation-first
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ elevation + watershed, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy()
```

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ elevation + watershed, data = hbr_maples_small) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt() 
```

</br>

. . .

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Do you think it matters which variable comes first?
:::

## Let's see...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: aov-watershed-first
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples) %>% 
  tidy()
```

</br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
aov(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, data = hbr_maples) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt() 
```

</br>

Did we get the same p-values as before?

## Sequential Versus Partial Sums of Squares

## An new function -- `Anova()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: anov-lm-code

library(car)

water_elev_lm <- lm(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) 

Anova(water_elev_lm, type = "III")
```

</br>

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: anov-lm-table

water_elev_lm <- lm(stem_dry_mass ~ watershed + elevation, 
    data = hbr_maples_small) 

Anova(water_elev_lm, type = "III") %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

## Keeping "non-significant" Variables

# Steps for Final Project 

## Hypothesis Test Steps

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #0F4C81;"}
Step 1: Fit a one-way ANOVA model for each categorical variable
:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #687244;"}
Step 2: Decide if each explanatory variable has a meaningful relationship with the response variable
:::
:::

::: fragment
-   If yes, then go to step 3!
-   If no, then report which variable (if any) has the strongest relationship with the response.

## Step 3 -- Fit an Additive Two-way ANOVA

## What about interaction models?

## Do you always expect your main effects to be "significant" in a two-way ANOVA?
