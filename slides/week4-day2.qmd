.pull-right\[ - Coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century

-   Described a biological phenomenon
    -   Heights of children of tall parents tend to be tall, but shorter than their parents \]

<!-- A phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean. -->

.pull-left\[ ![](images/correlation.jpg)\]

.pull-right\[ - In Statistics, Galton (1822--1911) is a towering figure.

-   He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA

-   Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity. \]

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

.larger\[The Invention of Eugenics\]

.pull-left\[ - The science of heredity could help humanity better itself through breeding.

-   Based on Greek *eugenes*, meaning "well-born"

-   Galton served as founding president of the British Eugenics Society \]

.pull-right\[ \> "What nature does blindly, slowly and ruthlessly, man may do providently, \> quickly, and kindly. As it lies within his power, so it becomes his duty to \> work in that direction."

--

-   From 1909 to 1979 California sterilized nearly 20,000 residents of the state mental institutions

--

-   In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did not violate the Constitution --- "...three generations of imbeciles are enough."
