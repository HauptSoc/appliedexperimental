-   In Statistics, Galton (1822--1911) is a towering figure.

-   He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA

-   Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity.
:::
:::

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

-   The science of heredity could help humanity better itself through breeding.

-   Based on Greek *eugenes*, meaning "well-born"

-   Galton served as founding president of the British Eugenics Society

-   In 1896 Connecticut made it illegal for people with epilepsy or who were "feeble-minded" to marry.

-   John Kellogg established a "pedigree registry"

-   From 1909 to 1979 California sterilized nearly 20,000 residents of the state mental institutions

-   In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did not violate the Constitution --- "...three generations of imbeciles are enough."

-   Between 1970 and 1976 between 25 and 50% of Native Americans were sterilized, many without consent
