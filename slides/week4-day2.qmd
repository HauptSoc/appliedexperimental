# Lab 2

## Revisions Due Friday

Please make sure you submitted reflections with your revisions! If there are not
revisions present when I start grading them on Saturday morning, your revisions
are not eligible to be regraded.

# Statistical Critique

## Common Mistakes

::: {.midi}
> "What variables go with each aesthetic?"

- I need you to be **specific** about what variable is being mapped to each 
component of the plot
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
> "Careful! Aesthetics are places where variables are being included on the
> plot, which is different from stylistic decisions made by the illustrator.
> Which of these aesthetics are associated with variables?"

:::

::: {.midi}
- Things like axis titles, grid lines, and annotations are stylistic decisions 
made by the plot creator. Aesthetics are places where **variables** are being
included in the plot. 
:::

## Statistical Critique Revisions

Are due on Wednesday, May 7. 

Next week the focus will be to get your Midterm Project first draft out the 
door, so we will postpone the revision deadline until the following week. 

You are welcome to complete your revisions before then!

-   Coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century

-   Described a biological phenomenon

    -   Heights of children of tall parents tend to be tall, but shorter than their parents
    -   "regression to the mean"

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   In Statistics, Galton (1822--1911) is a towering figure.

-   He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA

-   Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity.
:::

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

## The Invention of Eugenics

::::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Based on Greek *eugenes*, meaning "well-born"

-   The science of heredity could help humanity better itself through breeding.

-   Galton served as founding president of the [British Eugenics Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelphi_Genetics_Forum)

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *Mein Kampf* references the ideas of British and American eugenicists

#| fig-alt: "An image of protesters holding a 'Free Britney' sign and a 'Freedom for Britney 2020' sign. These signs represent the #FreeBritney movement, a social media campaign that advocated for Britney Spears to be released from her court-ordered conservatorship which had begun in 2008. The movement gained traction in 2019 and 2020, fueled by fan concerns about the conservatorship and its implications for Spears's well-being and autonomy. Ultimately, the movement played a significant role in raising awareness about the conservatorship and contributing to its eventual termination in 2021."

In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did not violate the Constitution.

In 1957 "conservatorship" was introduced "to avoid the stigma of incompetency"

# Lab 4

## Today's Data

::: small
> Data includes lake name, dates of freeze-up and thaw, and duration of ice cover of lakes in the Madison, WI area. Ice cover duration is the number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again. Lakes Monona and Wingra are considered to be frozen if they are completely ice covered, while Lake Mendota is considered to be frozen if there is ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and more than 50% of the lake is covered by ice.

![](images/madison.jpeg){fig-alt="An ariel photo of Madison, Wisconsin. The image shows the two lakes to the north and south of Madison and the medium sized skyline of buildings."}

## Research Question

</br> </br>

::: centered
> Has the duration of ice cover changed over the last 175 years?
