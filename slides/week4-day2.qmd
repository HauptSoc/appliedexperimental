# Lab 2

## Revisions Due Tonight

If you submitted revisions and your grade is still "Incomplete" -- either you forgot to submit reflections or you are being asked to complete a second round of revisions. 

# Lab 3

## A Grading Reminder

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Complete" = Satisfactory
:::

<br>

Your group obtained a "Success" on **every** question
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Incomplete" = Growing
:::

<br>

Your group received a "Growing" on *at least one* question

## Common Mistakes

::: small
-   Categorical variables in R (Q2)
    -   What data types does R use to store categorical variables? Integers? Characters? Doubles? Factors? Dates? 
-   Comparing distributions between groups (Q9)
    -   Were 

-   Comparing group means with distributions (Q11)
    - Where did you believe the "center" of the distribution was? 
    - Is that different from the means you are seeing? Why do you think that is?

## Copying the Lab -- Last Week's Recorder

The person who typed your lab needs to make their project "public"

1.  Open Posit Cloud
2.  Go to the STAT 313 / 513 workspace
3.  Click on "Your Content"
4.  Open the settings for your Lab 1 project

## Copying the Lab -- Last Week's Recorder

5.  Change the access for your project to "Space Members"

![](images/make-project-public.png)

## Copying the Lab -- Everyone Else

1.  Find your group member's lab (you can use the search bar to search for their name)

![](images/search-for-name.png)

2.  Open their Lab 2 project
3.  Select "Save a Permanent Copy"

## Completing Revisions

Lab 2 revisions are due by Thursday, February 1.

::: small
1.  Read comments on Canvas
2.  Copy your group's lab assignment
3.  Complete your revisions
4.  Render your revised Lab 2
5.  Download your revised HTML
6.  Submit your revisions to the [Lab 2 Revisions]{.underline} assignment

# Reflections

::: small
Revisions are required to be accompanied with reflections on what you learned while completing your revisions. These can be written in your Lab 1 Quarto file (next to the problems you revised), in a Word document, in the comment box on Canvas.

# The History of Regression

## Least Squares

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Published in 1805 by Legendre

```{r, out.width = "50%", out.height = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/legendre.jpg")
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
and Gauss in 1809

```{r, out.width = "50%", out.height = "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gauss.jpg")
```
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
Used to determine, from astronomical observations, the orbits of bodies about the Sun.

## "regression"

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/galton.png)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century

-   Described a biological phenomenon

    -   Heights of children of tall parents tend to be tall, but shorter than their parents
:::
:::

<!-- A phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean. -->

## A "polymath"

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/correlation.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   In Statistics, Galton (1822--1911) is a towering figure.

-   He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA

-   Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity.
:::
:::

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

## The Invention of Eugenics

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The science of heredity could help humanity better itself through breeding.

-   Based on Greek *eugenes*, meaning "well-born"

-   Galton served as founding president of the British Eugenics Society
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
> "What nature does blindly, slowly and ruthlessly, man may do providently, quickly, and kindly. As it lies within his power, so it becomes his duty to work in that direction."
:::
:::

## And then it spread...

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r, out.height = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hitler.jpg")
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *Mein Kampf* references American eugenics

-   Declared non-Aryan races inferior

-   Believed Germans should do everything possible to make sure their gene pool stayed "pure"
:::

## But wasn't that a long time ago?

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment}
![](images/native-sterilization.png)

:::{.small}
Between 1970 and 1976 between 25% and 50% of Native Americans were sterilized, many without consent
:::

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

::: {.column width="55%"}
:::{.fragment}
![](images/free-britney.jpeg)

::: {.small}
In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did not violate the Constitution --- "...three generations of imbeciles are enough."

</br>

In 1957 "conservatorship" was introduced as a "modern legal mechanism to meet a realistic human desire to avoid the stigma of incompetency"

# Lab 4

## Today's Data

::: small
> Data includes lake name, dates of freeze-up and thaw, and duration of ice cover of lakes in the Madison, WI area. Ice cover duration is the number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again. Lakes Monona and Wingra are considered to be frozen if they are completely ice covered, while Lake Mendota is considered to be frozen if there is ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and more than 50% of the lake is covered by ice.
:::

## Research Question

</br> </br>

::: centered
> Has the duration of ice cover changed over the last 175 years?
:::

## Data Layout

```{r}
