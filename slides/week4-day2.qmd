# Lab 2

## Revisions Due Tonight

Please make sure you submitted reflections with your revisions! If there are not revisions present when I start grading them tomorrow morning, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.

# Lab 3

## A Grading Reminder

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Complete" = Satisfactory
:::

<br>

Your group obtained a "Success" on **every** question
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Incomplete" = Growing
:::

<br>

Your group received a "Growing" on *at least one* question

## Common Mistakes

::: small
-   **Categorical variables in R (Q2)**
    -   What data types does R use to store categorical variables? Integers? Characters? Doubles? Factors? Dates?
-   **Comparing distributions between groups (Q9)**
    -   Are the distributions (centers, spreads, shapes) similar between the channel types? Are any channel types different?
    -   Are the distributions (centers, spreads, shapes) similar between the forest sections? Are any sections different?
    -   Was every channel type observed in both sections of forest?
-   **Comparing group means with distributions (Q11)**
    -   Where did you believe the "center" of the distribution was?
    -   Is that different from the means you are seeing? Why do you think that is?

## Copying the Lab -- Last Week's Recorder

The person who typed your lab needs to make their project "public"

1.  Open Posit Cloud
2.  Go to the STAT 313 workspace
3.  Click on "Your Content"
4.  Open the settings for your Lab 3 project

![](images/open-project-settings.png)

## Copying the Lab -- Last Week's Recorder

5.  Change the access for your project to "Space Members"

![](images/make-project-public.png)

## Copying the Lab -- Everyone Else

1.  Find your group member's lab (you can use the search bar to search for their name)

![](images/search-for-name.png)

2.  Open their Lab 3 project
3.  Select "Save a Permanent Copy"

## Completing Revisions

Lab 3 revisions are due by Wednesday, May 1.

::: small
1.  Read comments on Canvas
2.  Copy your group's lab assignment
3.  Complete your revisions
4.  Render your revised Lab 3
5.  Download your revised HTML
6.  Submit your revisions to the [original Lab 3]{.underline} assignment portal

# Reflections

::: small
Revisions are required to be accompanied with reflections on what you learned while completing your revisions. These can be written in your Lab 3 file (next to the problems you revised), in a Word document, or in the comment box on Canvas.

# The History of Regression

## Least Squares

:::{.incremental}
-   Coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century

-   Described a biological phenomenon

    -   Heights of children of tall parents tend to be tall, but shorter than their parents
    -   "regression to the mean"

## A "polymath"

::: columns

![](images/correlation.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   In Statistics, Galton (1822--1911) is a towering figure.

-   He invented standard deviation, correlation, linear regression, ANOVA

-   Galton's developments and discoveries were fueled in large part by his fascination with the science of heredity.
:::
:::

<!-- Galton was wrestling with the unanswered question of how different traits stayed stable in a population over generations, building on the work of his cousin Charles Darwin, who had published On the Origin of Species in 1859. -->

## The Invention of Eugenics

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Based on Greek *eugenes*, meaning "well-born"

-   The science of heredity could help humanity better itself through breeding.

-   Galton served as founding president of the [British Eugenics Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelphi_Genetics_Forum)

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *Mein Kampf* references the ideas of British and American eugenicists

-   Declared non-Aryan races inferior

-   Believed Germans should do everything possible to make sure their gene pool stayed "pure"

In 1927 the US Supreme Court ruled that sterilization of the handicapped did not violate the Constitution.

In 1957 "conservatorship" was introduced "to avoid the stigma of incompetency"

## Would you be in this class?

Is your skin white?

# Lab 4

## Today's Data

::: small
> Data includes lake name, dates of freeze-up and thaw, and duration of ice cover of lakes in the Madison, WI area. Ice cover duration is the number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again. Lakes Monona and Wingra are considered to be frozen if they are completely ice covered, while Lake Mendota is considered to be frozen if there is ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and more than 50% of the lake is covered by ice.
:::

![](images/madison.jpeg)

## Research Question

</br> </br>

::: centered
> Has the duration of ice cover changed over the last 175 years?
:::

## Data Layout

```{r}
#| label: data-preview
#| echo: false

set.seed(1234)

ntl_icecover %>% 
  group_by(lakeid) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 4) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%

# Recording the `year` of the winter

How is the `year` variable related to the `ice_on` and `ice_off` variables?
