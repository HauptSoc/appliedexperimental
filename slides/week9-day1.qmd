# Why?

##  {background-color="#B6CADA"}

::: {style="font-size: 4em; color: #000000;"}
Goal of an ANOVA
:::

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the means of three of more groups to detect if the means of the groups are different.

## 

::: {style="font-size: 4em; color: #B6CADA;"}
**How???**
:::

-   Compare how different a group of means are
-   Scale the differences relative to the variability of the groups
-   Summarize the differences with one number

# Visualizations for an ANOVA

# Visualizations for an ANOVA

We want visualizations that allow for us to easily compare:

-   the center (mean) of the groups
-   the spread (variability) of the groups

## 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 70%
#| label: age-cat-density

       y = "",
       x = "") +

**F-distribution**

An $F$-distribution is a variant of the $t$-distribution, and is also defined by degrees of freedom.

. . .

</br>

This distribution is defined by **two** different degrees of freedom:

:::{.small}
1.  from the numerator (MSG) : $k$ (number of groups) $- 1$
2.  from the denominator (MSE) : $n$ (number of observations) $- k$

-   Equal variability of the groups
