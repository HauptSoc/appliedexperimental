# Lab 1

## Revisions Due Tonight

If you submitted revisions and your grade is still "Incomplete" -- you forgot to submit reflections! Please add these as a comment to your assignment by the end of the day. 

# Lab 2

## A Grading Reminder

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Complete" = Satisfactory
:::

<br>

Your group obtained a "Success" on **every** question
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
"Incomplete" = Growing
:::

<br>

Your group received a "Growing" on *at least one* question
:::
:::

## Common Mistakes

:::{.small}
- Units in axis labels (Q2 & Q9)
  * What unit were the departure / arrival delays measured in?
  
- dimensions of filtered data (Q6)
  * How do the two numbers output relate to the size of the filtered dataset?
  
- Justifying *why* I should expect to be early / late (Q8 & Q10)
  * Why is the mean / median a reasonable estimate of the "typical" delay?
  * What aspect(s) of the distribution did you use to decide what a "typical" delay is?

# Review

## Today's Data

::: small
> The and_vertebrates dataset contains length and weight observations for Coastal Cutthroat Trout and two salamander species (Coastal Giant Salamander, and Cascade Torrent Salamander) in previously clear cut (c. 1963) and old growth coniferous forest sections of Mack Creek in HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, Willamette National Forest, Oregon.
:::

## Research Question

</br> </br>

::: centered
> Are there differences in fish biomass between clear cut and old growth sections of the HJ Andrews Forest?
:::

## Data Layout

```{r}
#| label: data-preview
#| echo: false

and_vertebrates %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 2) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

. . .

What are the observations / rows in this dataset?

## If you wanted to find the mean mass for Cutthroat trout in each section, what would you do? {background-color="#B6CADA"}

## Step 1: Remove Salamanders

</br> </br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| eval: false

trout <- filter(and_vertebrates, 
                species == "Cutthroat trout") 
```

## Step 2: `group_by()` + `summarize()`

```{r}
#| label: fish-mean-mass
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

trout %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(weight_g, 
                             na.rm = TRUE)
            )
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Why `na.rm = TRUE`?**
:::
:::

## Are they different?

```{r}
#| label: fish-mean-mass-table

trout %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(weight_g, 
                             na.rm = TRUE)
            ) %>% 
  rename(`Forest Section` = section, 
         `Mean Biomass` = mean_mass) %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

Would you conclude there is a difference in fish biomass between clear cut and old growth sections of the HJ Andrews Forest?

## Let's Make a Visualization!

```{r}
#| label: section-ridge-plots
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(data = trout, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight_g, 
                     y = section)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(x = "Weight of Cutthroat Trout (g)", 
       y = "Section of Forest") 
```

## Are they different?

```{r}
#| label: trout-plot-inference
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = trout, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight_g, 
                     y = section)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(x = "Weight of Cutthroat Trout (g)", 
       y = "Section of Forest") + 
  my_theme
```

Would you conclude there is a difference in fish biomass between clear cut and old growth sections of the HJ Andrews Forest?

## Let's Add in the Type of Channel

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
The channels (`unittype`) of the Mack Creek which were sampled were classified into the following groups:
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="15%"}
`"C"`

`"I"`

`"IP"`

`"P"`

`"R"`

`"S"`

`"SC"`

`NA`
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
cascade

riffle

isolated pool

pool

rapid

step (small falls)

side channel

not sampled by unit
:::
:::

## If you wanted to find the mean mass for Cutthroat trout for each *type of channel* in each *section*, what would you do? {background-color="#B6CADA"}

## `group_by()` + `summarize()`

```{r}
#| label: section-channel-mass
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

trout %>% 
  group_by(section, unittype) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(weight_g, 
                             na.rm = TRUE)
            )
```

## Visualization 2.0 -- Incorporating Color

```{r}
#| label: ridge-plots-with-color
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(data = trout, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight_g, 
                     fill = section, 
                     y = unittype)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Weight of Cutthroat Trout (g)", 
       fill = "Section of Forest", 
       y = "Type of Channel")
```

. . .

</br>

Why put `unittype` on the y-axis instead of `section`???

## Visualization 2.0 -- Incorporating Facets

```{r}
#| label: ridge-plots-with-facets
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(data = trout, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight_g, 
                     y = unittype)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(x = "Weight of Cutthroat Trout (g)", 
       y = "Section of Forest") +
  facet_wrap(~section)
```

# Ethical Considerations

## Choosing What to Measure

Keller et al. [-@keller2017] designed a study to examine whether a community-based suicide prevention project could increase willingness to seek professional help for suicidal ideation among eastern Montana youth.

. . .

</br>

Students attending the *Let's Talk* theater workshop, were asked to report their gender, race, and age.

## Choosing What to Measure

Researchers provided students with the following question:

> What is your gender?
>
> Male, Female, Other

. . .

What information are the researchers missing?

## Choosing What to Measure

$\beta$ blockers have been shown to improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure. These medicines block the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline). Research suggests that beta blockers have a differing effect for individuals with high levels of estrogen [@khan2000]. 

## Choosing What to Measure

The intake form for a local heart clinic asks the following question:

> What is your sex?
>
> Male, Female, Other
