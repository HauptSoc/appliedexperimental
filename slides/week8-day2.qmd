# Statistical Critique 2

## First Steps

::: {.incremental}
1.  Open the directions!
2.  Copy the Statistical Critique template on Posit Cloud
3.  Copy-and-paste code from your Midterm Project

- Insert the package to load in your data
- Insert the code to make the plots

4.  Copy-and-paste your justification for why you chose the model you chose
:::

## Next Steps

4.  Fit the most complex model
5.  Obtain an ANOVA table of your model
6.  Use the p-values in the ANOVA table to decide what model is "best"

## What is the "most complex" model?

Fit the **different slopes** (interaction) model

::: {.midi}
```{r}
#| label: diff-slopes-fit
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

species_lm <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm * species, 
                  data = penguins)
```
:::

</br>

. . .

```{r}
#| label: interaction-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
                     y = bill_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Bill Depth (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Length (mm)", 
       color = "Species") +
  my_theme
```

## Get the ANOVA table

```{r}
#| label: diff-slopes-anova
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false

anova(species_lm)
```

</br> 

```{r}
#| label: interaction-anova
#| echo: false

anova(species_lm) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
  rename(`F value` = statistic, 
         `Pr(>F)` = p.value, 
         Df = df, 
         `Sum Sq` = sumsq, 
         `Mean Sq` = meansq) %>% 
  gt() |> 
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(size = px(24)),
    locations = list(
      cells_body(),
      cells_column_labels()
    )
  ) |> 
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    locations = cells_column_labels()
  )
```

## Look at the Interaction Line of the ANOVA Table

![](images/anova-interaction.png){fig-alt="A table showing the results of an ANOVA test with four rows: 'bill_depth_mm', 'species', 'bill_depth_mm:species', and 'Residuals'. The columns are 'term', 'Df', 'Sum Sq', 'Mean Sq', 'F value', and 'Pr(>F)'. The interaction term 'bill_depth_mm:species' is highlighted with a purple border. It has 2 degrees of freedom, a sum of squares of 134.2515, a mean square of 67.125732, an F value of 11.23184, and a p-value of 1.897629e-05. The interaction is statistically significant."}


## How do I know what model is "best"?

The interaction line of the ANOVA table is testing:

::: {.small}
$H_0$: the slopes for the relationship between bill length and bill depth is
**the same** for **all** Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap penguins

$H_A$: the slopes for the relationship between bill length and bill depth is
**different** for **at least one** species of penguin
:::

## How do I know what model is "best"?

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #000000;"}
`bill_depth_mm:species`: With a p-value of 0.0000189, I would reject the null
hypothesis (that the slopes are all the same) and I would conclude that there is
evidence that the slopes are different!
:::

## What if I got a "large" p-value?

[Suppose, the p-value for `bill_depth_mm:species` was 0.45.]{.large}

[What model would be "best" in this scenario?]{.large}

# Getting Started on Your Final Project

## Step 1: Use the same dataset?

::: columns
::: {.column width="38%"}
[**Yes**]{.large}

::: {.midi}
- Choose **one** numeric response variable
- Choose **two** categorical explanatory variables
- Learn about how these variables were collected / recorded
:::
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
[**No**]{.large}

::: {.midi}
- Find a new dataset from the [list of datasets](../project/midterm-project/midterm-proposal-313.qmd).
- Learn about the dataset! 
- Choose **one** numeric response variable
- Choose **two** categorical explanatory variables
- Learn about how these variables were collected / recorded
:::
:::
:::

## Step 2: Write Your Introduction

::: {.midi}
Your Introduction should **at a minimum** address the following questions:

1. Who collected the data?
2. How were the data collected?
3. When were the data collected?
3. Why were the data collected? 
4. What question do these data address? 

::: {.callout-important}
# Research Question

You can hold off on a research question until we learn more about ANOVA next 
week!

## Step 3: Make a Copy of the Final Project Template

This will be posted by Friday! 

## Step 4: Pick out a Poster Template

These will be posted by Friday!

-   Decide on a variable transformation
-   Assess model conditions (L, I, N, E)
-   Compare hypothesis test results between simulation-based methods and
theory-based methods
