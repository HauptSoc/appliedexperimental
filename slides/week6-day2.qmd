# Deadline Extensions
You **cannot** request deadline extensions for the final version of your Midterm Project. The assignment portal closes at 12:00am on Monday. **Do not ride the line.**

# Midterm Project Review

## Help your peers!

- Are the arguments / sentences easy to understand? Does the report flow? 

- Is the same information included in multiple places?

- Do the plots have nice axis labels?

- Can you easily find the regression equations? Do the equations make sense?

- Do the interpretations / conclusions from the equations make sense?

- Do they justify *who* they can infer their results onto?

- Do they justify why they can / cannot use *causal* language?

# Peer Feedback

## Formatting Guidelines

- Don't write in bullet points
- Avoid redundancy as much as possible
- Make contents easy to navigate
  * Use subheaders and / or boldface to indicate important content
  * Place your regression equations on their own line

Better Practices for Data Visualization
:::

## Some Guidelines

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Titles should be top left aligned (usually)
- Don’t make people tilt their head
- Alignment should create clean lines and symmetry
- Remove and lighten grids as much as possible
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Legends suck
- Whitespace is like garlic; take the amount you need and then triple it
- Fonts matter
- Color is hard

## Tailoring Colors

Different color palettes are available through a variety of R packages. Popular options include:

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
:::{.fragment}
[RColorBrewer](https://r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)

[This website](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) provides an exhaustive list of color themes.

## Grids: [remove and lighten]{style="color: #34605f;"} as much as possible

![](images/backgrounds.png)

## A Reasonable Option -- `theme_minimal()`

</br>

```{r}
#| label: example-theme-minimal

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(ggridges)
library(lterdatasampler)

ggplot(data = nycflights, 
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Departure Delays (min)", 
      y = "", 
      title = "Number of Delayed Flights Leaving NYC Airports") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## An Example for Categorical

```{r}
#| label: example-color-discrete
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

and_vertebrates %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, 
                     y = weight_g, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Length (mm)", 
      y = "", 
      color = "Species",
      title = "Comparing Weight (g) versus Length (mm) \nfor Vertebrates in Mack Creek") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

```

## An Example for Continuous

```{r}
#| label: example-color-gradient
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

pie_crab %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = latitude, 
                     y = size, 
                     color = water_temp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Latitude", 
      y = "", 
      color = "Water Temperature (C)",
      title = "Size of Fiddler Crabs (mm) Across the Atlantic Coast") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "viridis")

```

# Lab 6

## Forward Selection (by Hand)

1. Start with the most basic model (one mean)

2. Decide which **one** variable to add (based on adjusted $R^2$)

3. Decide if you should add another variable

$\vdots$

4. Stop adding variables when adjusted $R^2$ stops increasing


## A More Automated Option

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: code-from-lab
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2,6,7"

evals_train %>% 
  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + <VARIABLES SELECTED>, data = evals_train)) %>% 
  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %>% 
  select(-ID, 
         -score,
         -<VARIABLE 1 SELECTED>,
         -<VARIABLE 2 SELECTED>
         ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "variable", 
               values_to = "adj_r_sq") %>% 
  slice_max(adj_r_sq)
```
