# Lab 1

## Plotting Your Data

Now that we've practiced making some plots, we know...

:::: small
`mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)` declares what variables are plotted
on the x- and y-axis.

::: callout-tip
The variable names you put insides `aes()` must be [**identical**]{.underline}
to the names of the variables in the dataset!
:::
::::

. . .

</br>

:::: small
`labs(x = "Highway Miles Per Gallon", y = "Car Manufacturer")` declares new 
x-axis and y-axis labels for the plot.

::: callout-tip
Including nice axis labels (with their units) is a critical part of [**every**]{.underline} visualization we make!

# Lab 2

## Departure Delays

-   Inspect the `nycflights` dataset
-   Visualize departure delays
-   Play with histogram `binwidth`
-   `filter()` data to include only certain flights
-   `calculate()` summary statistics
-   Make decisions based on summary statistics
-   Compare summary statistics to a visualization

# Working in Groups

## Cooperative Learning

is a structured form of small-group learning.

. . .

</br>

-   Roles relate to **how** the work should be done

    -   Roles **are not** about breaking up the work intellectually

. . .

-   Roles allow each person to contribute to the group in significant ways

    -   Each person's participation is necessary to complete the task

## Group Roles

::: columns
::: {.column width="44%"}
**Recorder** -- *Manages in-class report*

::: {.fragment}
::: {.small}
-   Talks with Resource Manager about ideas related to ways they could solve the
problem.
-   Responsible for organizing and recording answers to the assignment during
discussions.
-   Compiles a summary of the solutions discussed.
-   Submits final assignment.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="54%"}
**Resource Manager** -- *Manages resources for coding / statistical tasks*

::: {.fragment}
::: {.small}
-   Reads prompt and ensures Recorder understands what the problem is asking. 
-   Asks group questions to Dr. Theobold. 
-   Manages resources (e.g., cheatsheets, textbook, tutorials) for aiding in
solution strategy. 
-   Leads discussion and encourages participation from Recorder.
-   Brings conversation back if it deviates.

## Group Roles

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
**Recorder** -- *Manages in-class report*

::: {.small}
-   **Does not** ask the Resource Manager to solve the problem. 
-   **Does not** ask the Resource Manager to write the code for them. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.column width="51%"}
**Resource Manager** -- *Evaluates solution strategy*

::: {.small}
-   **Does not** solve the problem themselves. 
-   **Does not** tell the Recorder what to type.
-   **Does not** type for the Recorder. 
:::
:::

:::

. . .

::: {.small}
-   Helping someone means explaining your thinking **not** giving answers or doing the work for them

-   Provide a justification when you make a statement

-   Think and work together -- don't divide up the work

-   No cross talk with other groups
