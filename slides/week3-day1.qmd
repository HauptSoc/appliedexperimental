# Reflections

Revisions are required to be accompanied with reflections on what you learned
while completing your revisions. **Reflections must be written in your Lab 1
Quarto file (next to the problems you revised).**

# Categorical Variables

##  {background-color="#b4d4ec"}

<center>

::: {style="margin-top: 100px; font-size: 2.5em; color: #000000;"}
How would you describe a categorical variable?
:::

</center>

## In `R`...

categorical variables can have either `character` *or* `factor` data types

</br>

. . .

`factor` -- structured & fixed number of levels / options

-   can be ordered or unordered

</br>

. . .

`character` -- unstructured & variable number of levels

-   is inherently unordered

##  {background-color="#E4E4E4"}

::: {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}
Fill in the associated data types (e.g. character, factor, integer, double) with each type of variable.
:::

| Variable                      | Data Type in R |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Categorical variable          |                |
| Continuous numerical variable |                |
| Discrete numerical variable   |                |

If you wanted means for each level of a categorical variable, what would you do?

## Trout Size

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
The HJ Andrews Experimental Forest houses one of the larges long-term ecological research stations, specifically researching cutthroat trout and salamanders in clear cut or old growth sections of Mack Creek.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: group-by-summarize-trout
trout %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_length = mean(length_1_mm, 
                       na.rm = TRUE)

## Classifying Channel Types

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
The channels of the Mack Creek which were sampled were classified into the following groups:
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="15%"}
`"C"`

`"I"`

`"IP"`

`"P"`

`"R"`

`"S"`

`"SC"`

`NA`
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
cascade

riffle

isolated pool

pool

rapid

step (small falls)

side channel

not sampled by unit
:::
::::::

## `filter()`-ing Specific Channel Types

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
The majority of the Cutthroat trout were captured in cascades (C), pools (P), and side channels (SC). Suppose we want to only retain these levels of the `unittype` variable.

trout %>% 
  filter(
    unittype %in% c("C", "P", "SC")
         )
```

<center>**When we have more than one value we want to keep, we need to use `%in%` not `==`!**</center>

## Incorporating Categorical Variables into Data Visualizations

::: incremental
-   As a variable on the `x`- or `y`-axis

-   As a `color` / `fill`

-   As a facet
