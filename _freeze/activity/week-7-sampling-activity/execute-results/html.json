What is the central tenant of random sampling? i.e. How are observations selected from the study population?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n4.  Comment on the \"random-ness\" of the following studies:\n\n-   A Cal Poly administrator wants to know the average income of all graduates in the last 10 years. So they get the records of five randomly chosen graduates, contact them, and obtain their answers.\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n-   You want to know the prevalence of illegal downloading of TV shows among students at a local college. You get the emails of 100 randomly chosen students and ask them, \"How many times did you download a pirated TV show last week?\".\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n## Sampling Randomly\n\n5.  Suppose we have a database of every professor at UT Austin, and are interested in studying the relationship between evaluations and age.\n\n-   How would we go about randomly sampling observations from the database?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n-   Would we allow for individuals to be selected more than once?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n-   Would we expect that our sample look like the population at UT Austin?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n## Representative Sampling\n\n6.  What is the central tenant of representative sampling? i.e. How are observations selected from the study population?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n7.  Comment on the \"representative-ness\" of the following studies:\n\n-   The Royal Air Force wants to study how resistant all their airplanes are to bullets. They study the bullet holes on all the airplanes on the tarmac after an air battle against the Luftwaffe (German Air Force).\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n-   You want to know the average number of people in each household in your city. You randomly pick out 500 phone numbers from the phone book and conduct a phone survey.\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n## Sampling Representatively\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n------------------------------\n gender       rank       perc \n-------- -------------- ------\n female     teaching      6%  \n\n female   tenure track   10%  \n\n female     tenured      10%  \n\n  male      teaching     18%  \n\n  male    tenure track   14%  \n\n  male      tenured      42%  \n------------------------------\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   Female teaching = 28%\\\n-   Female tenure track = 15%\\\n-   Female tenured = 12%\n:::\n:::\n\n8.  Suppose we want to ensure that we have a representative proportion of faculty who are women and faculty of different tenure statuses. How would we go about collecting a representative sample that accounts for these demographic characteristics?\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Sampling Issues\n\nIn the `evals` data, the courses included in the dataset were only taught by 94 unique professors.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncount(evals, prof_ID)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 94 × 2\n   prof_ID     n\n     <int> <int>\n 1       1     4\n 2       2     3\n 3       3     2\n 4       4     8\n 5       5     6\n 6       6     7\n 7       7     5\n 8       8     7\n 9       9     7\n10      10    10\n# … with 84 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n9.  How would you use sampling to remedy this situation?\n:::\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Population Parameter\n\nTo investigate the relationship between course evaluation score and the professor's age, we would carry out a simple linear regression.\n\n10. What would be the population parameter we are interested in? Do we know its value?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n11. What would be our point estimate? What is its purpose?\n\n\\</br\\>\\</br\\>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Repeated Samples\n\nRepeated samples are necessary for us to create a sampling distribution like the one below.\n\n12. What are we assuming when we plot the result of every sample on the **same** distribution?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `dplyr::mutate()`.\nℹ In argument `..1 = dplyr::across(...)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!
