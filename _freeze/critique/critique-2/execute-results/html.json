Some speech bubbles say 'significant?', 'Significant.', 'significance.', 'significance', 'Significant!', and 'Significant.' in bold or stylized text. The image humorously illustrates the overuse and varied emphasis of the word 'significant' in scientific communication. \"}\n\n## Assignment Details\n\nIn your second statistical critique, you will focus on critiquing another key\naspect of any statistical argument---statistical significance. No doubt you have\nseen $p$-values in a previous statistical course and / or disciplinary course,\nand this week you're adding to that knowledge. For this critique you will\ncompare the model you selected in your Midterm Project with what model you would\nhave chosen based on a statistical test.\n\nThis critique involves coding! You can find a template for critique posted in\nthe STAT 313 main workspace on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/).\n\n## Part Zero: p-values in Multiple Linear Regression\n\nFor the first step of this critique, you are required to read about how p-values\ncan be used in the context of multiple linear regression: [Extending to Multiple Linear Regression](../weeks/chapters/week-8-reading-mlr.qmd \"Extending to Multiple Linear Regression\")\n\n# Part One: Revisiting the Midterm Project\n\nFor the first part of this critique, you are going to revisit the model you\nselected for your Midterm Project. You need to copy-and-paste the code you wrote\nin your Midterm Project to create your two visualizations. After these\nvisualizations, you should include the 2-3 sentences from your \n*Statistical Methods* subsection where you described *why* you chose the model\nyou did in your Midterm Project. Feel free to copy and paste from your \nMidterm Project!\n\n# Part Two: Using p-values Instead\n\nFor this second part, you are tasked with testing what regression model you\nwould have chosen if you had used p-values to make your decision. Regardless of\nthe model you chose for your Midterm Project, you will fit the **most complex**\nregression model. In the context of a multiple linear regression with one\nnumerical and one categorical explanatory variables, the most complex model is\nthe different slopes (interaction) model.\n\n**Step 1:** Fit a different slopes multiple linear regression\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_model <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm * species, \n               data = penguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Step 2:** Run an ANOVA to test if the groups have different slopes\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(my_model) |> \n  tidy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Based on the p-value(s) you obtained from the ANOVA table, what model is the \"best\"\nmodel?**\n\n# Part Three: Learning More about Misuses of $p$-values\n\n> \"The p-value was never intended to be a substitute for scientific reasoning.\" \n> Ron Wasserstein, Executive Director of the American Statistical Association\n\nIssues with the use of $p$-values had gotten so problematic that the American\nStatistical Association (ASA)[^1] put out a statement in 2016 titled,\n[\"The ASA Statement on Statistical Significance and $p$-Values\"](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf). This\nstatement includes six principles which address misconceptions and misuse of the\n$p$-value.\n\n[^1]: This is my professional organization.\n\n<!-- > \"Over time it appears the p-value has become a gatekeeper for whether work is -->\n<!-- > publishable. This apparent editorial bias leads to the 'file-drawer effect,' -->\n<!-- > in which research with statistically significant outcomes are much more likely -->\n<!-- > to get published, while other work that might well be just as important -->\n<!-- > scientifically is never seen in print. It also leads to practices called by -->\n<!-- > such names as 'p-hacking' and 'data dredging' that emphasize the search for -->\n<!-- > small p-values over other statistical and scientific reasoning.\" -->\n<!-- > -->\n<!-- > Jessica Utts, President of the American Statistical Association -->\n\nIn March of 2019, Valentin Amrhein, Sander Greenland, Blake McShane and more\nthan 800 signatories published an article in Nature [calling for an end to \"statistical significance\"](https://www-nature-com.calpoly.idm.oclc.org/articles/d41586-019-00857-9). The article\ndetails how, on top of the many common misunderstandings about hypothesis\ntesting and $p$-values, there is an incentive for researchers to \"cherry pick\"\nonly the results that are \"statistically significant\" while dismissing those\nthat aren't. There are two problems with this system:\n\n1.  It incentivizes researchers to do whatever it takes to obtain \"significant\"\np-values, even through dishonest means.\n\n2.  It dismisses the importance of results where no \"significant\" effects are\nfound.\n\n**Read the American Statistical Association's statement on $p$-values and \nstatistical significance [and]{.underline} the Nature article on \n\"statistical significance.**\n\n## Part Four: Reflection\n\nNow that you have compared the model you would have selected using p-values\ninstead of a visualization and the misuses of p-values, I would like you to \nreflect on the benefits and drawbacks of using p-values. \n\n1. What are the benefits of using p-values to assess the strength of evidence\nin a study? \n\n2. What are some limitations or drawbacks of relying solely on p-values to\ndetermine whether a result is meaningful or important?\n\n3. What is something you've learned in this activity that you will take with you\nin your future courses / research?\n",
