What are the benefits of using p-values to assess the strength of evidence\nin a study? \n\n2. What are some limitations or drawbacks of relying solely on p-values to\ndetermine whether a result is meaningful or important?\n\n3. What is something you've learned in this activity that you will take with you\nin your future courses / research?\n",
