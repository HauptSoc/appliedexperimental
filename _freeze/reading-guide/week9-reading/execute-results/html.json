We then shuffled the cards and created new ($x$, $y$) pairs by resampling from the data without replacement. \n\n**How do we simulate what could have happened if $H_0$ was true for an ANOVA?**\n\n</br>\n</br>\n\n**What tail do we use to calculate the p-value for an ANOVA?**\n\n</br>\n</br>\n\n**If you reject $H_0$ in an ANOVA what can you conclude?**\n\n</br>\n</br>\n\n## Section 3 -- Mathematical Model\n\n**What distribution do we use to calculate the p-value for a theory-based ANOVA?**\n\n</br>\n</br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|term      |  df|      sumsq|    meansq| statistic|  p.value|\n|:---------|---:|----------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|\n|gender    |   1|   2.260213| 2.2602134|  7.753005| 0.005583|\n|Residuals | 461| 134.394128| 0.2915274|        NA|       NA|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**In the ANOVA table above, what does the `statistic` column represent?**\n\n</br>\n</br>\n\n**How was that `statistic` calculated?
