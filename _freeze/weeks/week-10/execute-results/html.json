This is called a **two-way ANOVA**. A two-way ANOVA extends the one-way ANOVA to situations with two categorical explanatory variables. This new methods allows researchers to simultaneously study two variables that might explain variability in the responses and explore whether the impacts of one explanatory variable change depending on the level of the other explanatory variable.\n\n# Prepare\n\n## Textbook Reading\n\nTo be honest, I didn't have the energy this week to write another chapter on two-way ANOVA. So, instead we will be reading a couple of sections out of another statistics textbook. I've uploaded the PDFs of these sections to OneDrive, so you should be able to read them online or download them.\n\n### Section 1 -- [Introduction to Two-Way ANOVA](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/atheobol_calpoly_edu/EdX8FHcfU01KtG0882va4P0BUw20MAg6c8opXMmbJvZfDg?e=pFuVM5)\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Read through \"Step 6\" on page 222\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n# Example 3.1 -- Problematic Undertones\n\nI want to point out that the context of example 3.1 in this section has some major problematic undertones. The example focuses on \"the effects of corporate and endorser credibility\" on how likely someone is to buy shoes. For no clear reason, the example only considers \"female\" college students, which implicitly sends two problematic messages, (1) sex and gender are the same, and (2) women are more easily swayed by advertising.\n\nIn addition, the example uses Roseanne Barr as one of the celebrity endorsers---an actress who has [written deplorable remarks about transgender people](https://www.advocate.com/people/2018/4/17/dont-forget-roseannes-transphobia).\n:::\n\n### Section 2 -- [Two-Way ANOVA Interaction Models](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/atheobol_calpoly_edu/EbRUJgkN1wdCryI6ZlQjKrEBvo1EkIRxd0ugwbE4Xt8wDg?e=CS5U5X)\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Read through \"Follow-up Confidence Intervals\" on page 239\n:::\n\n### Reading Guide -- Due Monday by the start of Class\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week10-reading.docx)\n\n## Concept Quiz -- Due Monday by the start of class\n\n**1.
