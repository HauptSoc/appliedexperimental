This is called a **two-way ANOVA**. A two-way ANOVA extends the one-way ANOVA to situations with two categorical explanatory variables. This new methods allows researchers to simultaneously study two variables that might explain variability in the responses and explore whether the impacts of one explanatory variable change depending on the level of the other explanatory variable.\n\n# Textbook Reading\n\nTo be honest, I didn't have the energy this week to write another chapter on two-way ANOVA. So, instead we will be reading a couple of sections out of another statistics textbook. I've uploaded the PDFs of these sections to OneDrive, so you should be able to read them online or download them.\n\nhttps://tuos-bio-data-skills.github.io/intro-stats-book/anova-for-randomised-block-designs.html\n\n\n### Reading Guide -- Due Monday by the start of Class\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week10-reading.docx)\n\n## Concept Quiz -- Due Monday by the start of class\n\n**1.
