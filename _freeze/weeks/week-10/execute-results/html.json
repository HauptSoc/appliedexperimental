This is called a **two-way ANOVA**. A two-way ANOVA\nextends the one-way ANOVA to situations with two categorical explanatory \nvariables. This new methods allows researchers to simultaneously study two\nvariables that might explain variability in the responses and explore whether\nthe impacts of one explanatory variable change depending on the level of the\nother explanatory variable.\n\n# Textbook Reading\n\n[**Required Reading:** ANOVA for Randomized Block Designs](https://tuos-bio-data-skills.github.io/intro-stats-book/anova-for-randomised-block-designs.html)\n\n### Reading Guide -- Due Monday by the start of Class\n\n[Download the Word Document](reading-guide/week10-reading.qmd)\n\n## Concept Quiz -- There is no quiz this week, only the reading guide!\n\n<!-- **1.

Which of the following are conditions of a two-way ANOVA model?** (Select all that apply) -->\n\n<!-- -   independence of observations between the groups -->\n<!-- -   independence of observations within each group -->\n<!-- -   independence of variables -->\n<!-- -   normally distributed responses within each group -->\n<!-- -   normally distributed residuals -->\n<!-- -   linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables -->\n<!-- -   equal variance of residuals -->\n<!-- -   equal variance of responses within each group -->\n\n<!-- </br> -->\n\n<!-- **4. Which of the following is important to consider when assessing independence?** (Select all that apply) -->\n\n<!-- -   If the same observational unit (e.g., person, penguin, tree) could be sampled multiple times -->\n\n<!-- -   If observations could be biologically related (e.g., parents, siblings, etc.) -->\n\n<!-- -   If observations could be spatially related (e.g., countries that border each other) -->\n\n<!-- -   If there is a relationship between the observations and the response variable -->\n\n<!-- </br> -->\n\n<!-- **5. \\[True or False\\] When an additive model is fit, the interpretation of the p-value associated with each explanatory variable is \\[conditional / independent\\] on the other explanatory variable(s) in the model.** -->\n\n<!-- </br> -->\n\n<!-- **6. If the null hypothesis is rejected in an additive two-way ANOVA model, what model should be fit instead?** -->\n\n<!-- -   separate one-way ANOVA models -->\n<!-- -   a one-way ANOVA model containing the variable with the smallest p-value (from the additive two-way ANOVA) -->\n<!-- -   a mean only model -->\n<!-- -   an interaction two-way ANOVA model -->\n<!-- -   a simple linear regression -->\n\n</br>\n\n## R Tutorial -- Due Wednesday by the start of class\n\n[Click here to access this week's R tutorial](https://allisontheobold.shinyapps.io/two-way-anova)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Submission\n\nThe layout of this tutorial is a bit different from the others.
