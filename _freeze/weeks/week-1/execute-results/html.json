What are the different types of variables that can appear in a dataset? Select all that apply!**\n\n-   discrete numerical\n-   ordinal categorical\n-   nominal categorical\n-   continuous numerical\n-   discrete categorical\n\n**2.  Just because a variable has numeric values, does not mean it is a numeric variable. Which of the following variables appear numerical but behave like a categorical variable? Select all that apply!**\n\n-   zip code\n-   GPA\n-   height\n-   year in school\n\n**3.  Which of the following statements are true about observational studies and experiments? Select all that apply!**\n\n-   Experiments randomly assign the explanatory variable\n-   Observational studies randomly assign the explanatory variable\n-   Observational studies can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables\n-   Experiments can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables\n\n**4.  What are different methods for sampling from a population? Select all that apply!**\n\n-   simple random sampling\n-   stratified random sampling\n-   cluster sampling\n-   multistage sampling\n-   convenience sampling\n\n**5.  Cluster sampling and stratified sampling both rely on grouping observations, but have important differences. Match each method to how observations are randomly sampled.**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n**stratified sampling**\n\n**cluster sampling**\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n*groups of observations are created, groups are randomly selected, every observation in the selected group is sampled*\n\n*groups of observations are created, observations within a group are randomly sampled*\n:::\n:::\n\n# R Tutorial -- Due Thursday by noon\n\nüíª [**Required Tutorial:** Language of Data](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-01/#section-welcome)\n\n::: callout-note\n# Submission\n\nSubmit a screenshot of the completion page to the Canvas assignment portal!\n:::\n\n# Statistics in Your Field\n\nNow let's investigate how statistics is used in your discipline.\n\nFind a peer-reviewed article from a journal in your field that performs a statistical analysis somewhere in the paper. You **do not** need to be familiar with the analysis they do. That being said, if you want to find a paper that uses a statistical method we'll cover in this class, look for a paper that uses \"linear regression\" or \"ANOVA.\"\n\nThe Library is a great resource for this! The [following website (https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/jsearch?vid=01CALS_PSU:01CALS_PSU)](https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/jsearch?vid=01CALS_PSU:01CALS_PSU) has a list of journals by discipline that are available through the library.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\nIf you are having a hard time finding a peer reviewed journal article, here is a video of me talking through how I found one: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8ibJ0Pkhs>\n:::\n\n## Statistical Critique Step 0 -- Due Friday by 5pm\n\nUpload a PDF of your journal article to the Canvas assignment portal.\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\"}\nBack to [course schedule](/ \"Course schedule\") ‚èé\n:::\n",
