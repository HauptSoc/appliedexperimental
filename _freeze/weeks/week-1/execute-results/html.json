What are the different types of variables that can appear in a dataset? (select all that apply)\n\n-   discrete numerical\n-   ordinal categorical\n-   nominal categorical\n-   continuous numerical\n-   discrete categorical\n\n2.  Just because a variable has numeric values, does not mean it is a numeric variable. Which of the following variables appear numerical but behave like a categorical variable? (select all that apply)\n\n-   zip code\n-   GPA\n-   height\n-   year in school\n\n3.  Which of the following statements are true about observational studies and experiments? (select all that apply)\n\n-   Experiments randomly assign the explanatory variable\n-   Observational studies randomly assign the explanatory variable\n-   Observational studies can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables\n-   Experiments can make causal statements about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables\n\n4.  What are different methods for sampling from a population? (select all that apply)\n\n-   simple random sampling\n-   stratified random sampling\n-   cluster sampling\n-   multistage sampling\n-   convenience sampling\n\n5.  Cluster sampling and stratified sampling both rely on grouping observations, but have important differences. Match each method to how observations are randomly sampled.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n**stratified sampling**\n\n**cluster sampling**\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n*groups of observations are created, groups are randomly selected, every observation in the selected group is sampled*\n\n*groups of observations are created, observations within a group are randomly sampled*\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Statistics in Your Field\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è [**Required Video:** How to Find a Peer Reviewed Journal Article (6 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8ibJ0Pkhs)\n\nNow let's investigate how statistics is used in your discipline.\n\nFind a peer-reviewed article from a journal in your field that performs a statistical analysis somewhere in the paper. You **do not** need to be familiar with the analysis they do. That being said, if you want to find a paper that uses a statistical method we'll cover in this class, look for a paper that uses \"regression\" or \"ANOVA.\"\n\nThe Library is a great resource for this! The following website <https://csu-calpoly.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/jsearch?vid=01CALS_PSU:01CALS_PSU> has a list of journals by discipline that are available through the library.\n\n## ‚úÖ Check-in\n\nUpload a PDF of your journal article to the Canvas assignment portal.\n\n</br>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Philosophy of Statistical Inference\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è [**Required Video:** Philosophy of Statistics (3 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K511BpyoTzU)\n\nüìñ [**Required Reading:** Our love of dichotomizing](https://critical-inference.com/our-love-of-dichotomizing/)\n\nüìñ [**Required Reading:** Science is Human](https://critical-inference.com/science-is-human/)\n\nüìñ [**Required Reading:** *Do We Really Need the S-word?*](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/do-we-really-need-the-s-word)\n\n</br>\n\n## Conceptual Questions\n\nThroughout the week, you will be asked to reflect on the following questions:\n\n-   What is **S**tatistics?\n\n-   What are two similarities and two differences between Statistics and Mathematics?\n\n-   What is the role of Statistics in the progression of science?\n\n-   How is dichotomous thinking used in Statistics? What are two benefits and drawbacks of dichotomous thinking?\n\n-   What does it mean for an analysis to be \"objective\"? Do you believe statistical analyses can be objective? Why or why not?\n\n-   What are 4-5 synonyms of \"significant\" that come to your mind?\n\n-   What are two issues that you see with using the term \"significant\" to denote \"small\" p-values?\n",
