These comparisons have a specific name, ANalysis of VAriance (ANOVA). \n\n\nWe are going to use all of the simulation-based methods we learned previously \nfor this new context. An ANOVA relies on a new statistic, the $F$-statistic, to \nsummarize how different 3 or more means are from each other. \n\nThe primary focus of an ANOVA is to detect if the means of 3 or more groups are \ndifferent. Because of this we focus on hypothesis tests for a difference in the \ngroup means and **do not** use confidence intervals. We will generate\npermutation distributions of $F$-statistics that we could have observed\n**if the null hypothesis was true** (there is no difference in the group means).\n\n\n## Learning Outcomes \n\nBy the end of this coursework you should be able to:\n\n- describe what an ANOVA tests for \n- use a visualization to outline how the following are calculated: \n  * total sum of squares\n  * group sum of squares\n  * residual sum of squares\n\n- describe why the mean squares of groups is called the \"between group\nvariability\" \n- describe why the mean square error is called the \"within group variability\" \n- outline how an F-statistic is calculated\n- explain what a \"large\" or a \"small\" F-statistic indicates\n\n- describe the conditions for performing an ANOVA procedure\n- outline when it is appropriate to use an $F$-distribution in an ANOVA\n- explain the similarities and differences between parametric ($F$-based)\nmethods and non-parametric (simulation-based) methods\n\n- use R to:\n  * generate a permutation distribution for F-statistics\n  * visualize the permutation distribution\n  * calculate the observed F-statistic statistic\n  * calculate a p-value for a hypothesis test\n\n\n---\n\n## This Week's TODOs\n\nðŸ“– Reading: 45-60 minutes \n\nðŸ’» Tutorial: 30-45 minutes\n\nðŸ—ž Group Discussion Homework: ANOVA Project  \n\nâœ… Check-ins: 2\n\n---\n\n## Comparing Multiple Means\n\n### ðŸ“– [**Required Reading:** *IMS*, Inference for Comparing Many Means](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-many-means.html)\n\n---\n\n## Randomization Tests for Comparing Many Means\n\n### ðŸ’» [Comparing many means with ANOVA - R Tutorial](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-05-infer-08/)\n\n---\n\n## Mathematical Model for Comparing Many Means\n\n### âœ… Check-in: Components of an ANOVA\n\n1. Which of the following are true about the mean squares between groups?\n\n- it is a standardized measure of the variability in responses between groups\n- it compares the mean of each group to the overall mean across all groups\n- it compares the observations within each group to the mean of that group\n- it is used as the numerator in an F-statistic\n- it is used as the denominator in an F-statistic\n- it is found by dividing the sum of squares between groups by the number of \ngroups minus 1 ($k$ - 1)\n- it is found by dividing the sum of squares between groups by the sample size\nminus the number of groups ($n - k$)\n\n2. Which of the following are true about the mean square errors?\n\n- it is a standardized measure of the variability in responses within each \ngroup\n- it compares the mean of each group to the overall mean across all groups\n- it compares the observations within each group to the mean of that group\n- it is used as the numerator in an F-statistic\n- it is used as the denominator in an F-statistic\n- it is found by dividing the sum of square errors by the number of groups\nminus 1 ($k$ - 1)\n- it is found by dividing the sum of square errors by the sample size minus \nthe number of groups ($n - k$)\n\n3. An F-statistic uses which formula? \n\n- $\\frac{MSG}{MSE}$\n\n- $\\frac{SSG}{SSE}$\n\n- $\\frac{MSE}{MSG}$\n\n- $\\frac{SSE}{SSG}$\n\n4. Ideally, in an ANOVA we'd like to see... (select all that apply)\n\n- large variability in the means of the groups \n- small variability in the means of the groups \n- large variability in the observations within each group\n- small variability in the observations within each group\n\n5. If the null hypothesis that the means of four groups are all the same is\nrejected using ANOVA at a 5% significance level, then... (select all that apply)\n\n- we can then conclude that all the means are different from one another.\n\n- the variability between groups is higher than the variability within groups.\n\n- the pairwise analysis will identify at least one pair of means that are\nsignificantly different.\n\n- an appropriate $\\alpha$ to be used in pairwise comparisons is\n$\\frac{0.05}{4} = 0.0125$ since there are four groups.\n \n---\n\n## Chapter Review \n\n### âœ… Check-in: ANOVA Conditions\n\n**These are all true or false questions, so you will be given _one_ attempt for \nthis quiz**\n\n1. As the total sample size increases, the degrees of freedom for the residuals\nincreases.\n\n2. The constant variance condition can be somewhat relaxed when the sample sizes\nare large.\n\n3. The independence assumption can be relaxed when the total sample size is\nlarge.\n\n4. The normality condition is very important when the sample sizes of each \ngroup are small. \n\n---\n\n## Group Project\n\n**Detailed instructions can be found on Canvas.** \n\n---\n\n## Think Out Loud\n\n**Take one concept you have worked on this quarter that you struggled to\nunderstand, and explain how the struggle itself was valuable.**\n\nIn the context of this question, describe the struggle and how you overcame the\nstruggle. You might also discuss whether struggling built aspects of character\nin you (e.g. endurance, self-confidence, competence to solve new problems) and\nhow these virtues might benefit you in later ventures.\n\n",
