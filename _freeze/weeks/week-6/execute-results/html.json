If the \\[R-squared / correlation / adjusted R-squared\\] when the variable is \\[added / removed\\] is \\[smaller / larger\\], the variable will be \\[added / removed\\] from the final model.\n\n**Question 7** -- Forward selection starts with the model with \\[no / every\\] explanatory variable included.\n\n**Question 8** -- Forward selection \\[adds / removes\\] variables from the model.
