Using the example of estimating the proportion of red balls in a bowl, we started with a \"tactile\" exercise where a shovel was used to draw a sample of balls from the bowl. While we could have performed an exhaustive count of **all** the balls in the bowl, this would have been a tedious process. So instead, we used a shovel to extract a sample of balls and used the resulting proportion that were red as an *estimate*. Furthermore, we made sure to mix the bowl's contents before every use of the shovel. Because of the randomness created by the mixing, different uses of the shovel yielded different proportions red and hence different estimates of the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red.\n\nWe then used R to mimic this \"tactile\" sampling process. Using our computer's random number generator, we were able to quickly mimic the tactile sampling procedure a large number of times. Moreover, we were able to explore how different our results would be if we used different sized shovels, with 25, 50, and 100 slots. When we visualized the results of these three different shovel sizes, we saw that as the sample size increased, the variation in the estimates ($\\widehat{p}$) decreased.\n\nThese visualizations of the repeated sampling from the bowl have a special name in Statistics -- a *sampling distribution*. These distributions all us to study how our estimates (\\$\\widehat{p}) varied from one sample to another; in other words, we wanted to study the effect of *sampling variation*. Once we had over 1,000 different estimates, we quantified the variation of these estimates using their standard deviation, which also has a special name in Statistics -- the *standard error*. Visually we saw the spread of the sampling distributions get narrower as the sample size increased, which was reiterated by the standard errors -- the standard errors decreased as the sample size increased. This decrease in spread of the sampling distribution gives us more *precise* estimates that varied less around the center.\n\nWe then tied these sampling concepts to the statistical terminology and mathematical notation related to sampling. Our *study population* was the large bowl with $N$ = 2400 balls, while the *population parameter*, the unknown quantity of interest, was the population proportion $p$ of the bowl's balls that were red. Since performing a *census* would be expensive in terms of time and energy, we instead extracted a *sample* of size $n$ = 50. The *point estimate*, also known as a *sample statistic*, used to estimate $p$ was the sample proportion $\\widehat{p}$ of these 50 sampled balls that were red. Furthermore, since the sample was obtained at *random*, it can be considered as *unbiased* and *representative* of the population. Thus any results based on the sample could be *generalized* to the population. Therefore, the proportion of the shovel's balls that were red was a \"good guess\" of the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red. In other words, we used the sample to *infer* about the population.\n\nHowever, we acknowledged that both the tactile and virtual sampling exercises are not what one would do in real life; this was merely an activity used to study the effects of sampling variation. In a real-life situation, we would not take 1,000s of samples of size $n$, but rather take a *single* representative sample that's as large as possible. Additionally, we knew that the true proportion of the bowl's balls that were red was 37.5%. In a real-life situation, we will not know what this value is. Because if we did, then why would we take a sample to estimate it?\n\nSo how does one quantify the effects of sampling variation when you only have a *single sample* to work with? You cannot directly study the effects of sampling variation when you only have one sample. One common method to study this is *bootstrapping resampling*, which will be the focus of the earlier sections of this reading.\n\nFurthermore, what if we would like not only a single estimate of the unknown population parameter, but also a *range of highly plausible* values? For example, when you read about political polls, they tell you the percent of all Californians who support a specific measure, but in addition to this estimate they provide the poll's \"margin of error\". This margin of error can be used to construct a range of plausible values for the true percentage of people who support a specific measure. This range of plausible values is what's known as a *confidence interval*, which will be the focus of the later sections of this reading.\n\n## Baby Birth Weights\n\nMedical researchers may be interested in the relationship between a baby's birth weight and the age of the mother, so as to provide medical interventions for specific age groups if it is found that they are associated with lower birth weights.\n\nEvery year, the US releases to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in the country. The [`births14`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/births14.html) dataset is a random sample of 1,000 cases from one such dataset released in 2014.\n\n### Observed data\n\n@fig-births-slr visualizes the relationship between `mage` and `weight` for this sample of 1,000 birth records.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = births14, \n       mapping = aes(x = mage, y = weight)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mother's Age\", \n       y = \"Birth Weight of Baby (lbs)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Weight of baby at birth (in lbs) as explained by mother's age.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-births-slr-1.png){#fig-births-slr width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@tbl-births-slr displays the estimated regression coefficients for modeling the relationship between `mage` and `weight` for this sample of 1,000 birth records.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths_lm <- lm(weight ~ mage, data = births14)\n\nget_regression_table(births_lm)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-births-slr .cell tbl-cap='The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope for modeling the relationship between baby\\'s birth weight and mother\\'s age.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> std_error </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> statistic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> p_value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> lower_ci </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> upper_ci </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> intercept </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.793 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.208 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 32.651 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.385 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7.201 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> mage </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.007 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.987 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.047 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.028 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on these coefficients, the estimated regression equation is:\n\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{birth weight}} = -6.793 + 0.014 \\times \\text{mother's age}$$\n\n::: callout-note\nWe will let $\\beta_1$ represent the slope of the relationship between baby's birth weight and mother's age for **every** baby born in the US in 2014. We will estimate $\\beta_1$ using the `births14` dataset, labeling the estimate $b_1$ (just as we did in Week 4).\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\nA **parameter** is the value of the statistic of interest for the entire **population**.\n\nWe typically estimate the parameter using a \"point estimate\" from a sample of data. The point estimate is also referred to as the **statistic**.\n:::\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nThis sample of 1,000 births is only one of possibly tens of thousands of possible samples that could have been taken from the large dataset released in 2014. So, then we might wonder how different our regression equation would be if we had a different sample. There is no reason to believe that $\\beta_1$ is 0.279, but there is also no reason to believe that $\\beta_1$ is particularly far away from $b_1 =$ 0.279.\n\nJust this week you read about how estimates, such as $b_1$, are prone to sampling variation -- the variability from sample to sample. For example, if we took a different sample of 1,000 births, would we obtain a slope of exactly 0.279? No, that seems fairly unlikely. We might obtain a slope of 0.29 or 0.26, or even 0.35!\n\nWhen we studied the effects of sampling variation, we took many samples, something that was easily done with a shovel and a bowl of red and white balls. In this case, however, how would we obtain another sample? Well, we would need to go to the source of the data---the large public dataset released in 2014---and take another random sample of 1,000 observations. Maybe we don't have access to that original dataset of 2014 births, how could we study the effects of sampling variation using our single sample? We will do so using a technique known as **bootstrap resampling with replacement**, which we now illustrate.\n\n### Resampling once\n\n![Step 1: Write out mother's ages and baby's birth weights on 1,000 slips of paper representing one of the 1,000 births included in the original sample.](images/baby-postit.jpg){#fig-baby-post-it}\n\n**Step 1**: Print out 1,000 identically sized slips of paper (or post-it notes) representing the sample of 1,000 babies in our sample. On each piece of paper, write the mother's age and the birth weight of the baby. @fig-baby-post-it displays six of these such papers.\n\n**Step 2**: Put the 1,000 slips of paper into a hat as seen in @fig-hat.\n\n![Step 2: Putting 1,000 slips of paper (post-its) in a hat.](images/hat.JPG){#fig-hat}\n\n**Step 3**: Mix the hat's contents and draw one slip of paper at random, as seen in @fig-draw-out. Record the mother's age and baby's birth weight, as printed on the paper.\n\n![Step 3: Drawing one slip of paper at random.](images/draw-out2.jpg){#fig-draw-out}\n\n**Step 4**: Put the slip of paper back in the hat! In other words, replace it as seen in @fig-put-back.\n\n![Step 4: Replacing slip of paper.](images/put-back.jpg){#fig-put-back}\n\n**Step 5**: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 a total of 999 more times, resulting in 1,000 recorded mother's ages and baby birth weights.\n\nWhat we just performed was a *resampling* of the original sample of 1,000 birth records. We **are not** sampling 1,000 birth records from the population of all 2014 US births as we did for our original sample. Instead, we are mimicking this process by resampling 1,000 birth records from our original sample.\n\nNow ask yourselves, why did we replace our resampled slip of paper back into the hat in Step 4? Because if we left the slip of paper out of the hat each time we performed Step 4, we would end up with the **same** 1,000 birth records! In other words, replacing the slips of paper induces *sampling variation*.\n\nBeing more precise with our terminology, we just performed a *resampling with replacement* from the original sample of 1,000 birth records. Had we left the slip of paper out of the hat each time we performed Step 4, this would be *resampling without replacement*.\n\nLet's study our sample of 1,000 resampled birth records. First, I've made a table of the number of times each observation (birth record) was resampled. @tbl-resample-id displays the birth records that were resampled the most often. Based on the table, it appears that record IDs 71 and 534 were resampled six times.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-resample-id .cell tbl-cap='Frequencies of how often a given birth record (ID) was resampled.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 71 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 534 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 170 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 561 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 142 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 305 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 309 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 495 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 573 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 726 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 727 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 835 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 838 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 840 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 864 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 919 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 924 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 929 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 953 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Remember\n\nWhen sampling with replacement, not every observation is guaranteed to be sampled.

A computer, however, would be happy to do this process for us!\n\n### Virtually resampling once\n\nFirst, let's perform the virtual analog of resampling once. Recall that the `births14` dataset included in the **openintro** package contains the 1,000 birth records from the original study. Furthermore, recall in the last chapter that we used the `rep_sample_n()` function as a virtual shovel to sample balls from our virtual bowl of 2400 balls as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nLet's modify this code to perform the resampling *with replacement* from the 1,000 birth records in the original sample:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvirtual_resample <- rep_sample_n(births14, \n                                 size = 1000,\n                                 replace = TRUE, \n                                 reps = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nObserve how we explicitly set the `replace` argument to `TRUE` in order to tell `rep_sample_n()` that we would like to sample birth records *with replacement*. Had we not kept `replace = FALSE`, we would have done resampling *without replacement*. Additionally, we changed the sample `size`, as we need to create a sample with the *same* size as the original sample which had 1,000 observations.\n\nLet's look at only the first 10 out of 1,000 rows of `virtual_resample`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvirtual_resample\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 15\n# Groups:   replicate [1]\n   replicate    ID  mage weight  fage mature      weeks premie    visits gained\n       <int> <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <int> <chr>       <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1         1   333    29   7.4     31 younger mom    39 full term     13     50\n 2         1   595    29   0.75    NA younger mom    21 premie         4     NA\n 3         1   338    31   6.94    NA younger mom    39 full term      9     20\n 4         1   531    33   6.94    37 younger mom    39 full term     14     20\n 5         1   289    35   7.98    35 mature mom     38 full term     10     40\n 6         1   461    32   7.15    33 younger mom    39 full term     13     NA\n 7         1   137    26   7.69    36 younger mom    38 full term     NA     25\n 8         1   828    36   4.54    65 mature mom     36 premie        11     10\n 9         1   118    26   8.31    24 younger mom    37 full term     12     25\n10         1    95    38   6.04    37 mature mom     36 premie        10     32\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: lowbirthweight <chr>, sex <chr>, habit <chr>,\n#   marital <chr>, whitemom <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `replicate` variable only takes on the value of 1 corresponding to us only having `reps = 1`, the `ID` variable indicates which of the 1,000 birth records was resampled, and `mage` and `weight` denote mother's age and the baby's birth weight, respectively.\n\nLet's now compute the slope for the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight for this resample:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvirtual_resample_lm <- lm(weight ~ mage, data = virtual_resample)\n\nget_regression_table(virtual_resample_lm)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-virtual-resample-lm .cell tbl-cap='The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope for modeling the relationship between baby\\'s birth weight and mother\\'s age, for the virtual resample of 1,000 birth records.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> std_error </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> statistic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> p_value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> lower_ci </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> upper_ci </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> intercept </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7.156 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.224 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 31.974 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.716 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7.595 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> mage </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.002 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.008 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.210 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.834 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -0.014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.017 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we saw when we did our tactile resampling exercise, @tbl-virtual-resample-lm shows that the estimated slope is different from the slope of our original sample of 0.005.\n\n### **infer** package workflow\n\nUnfortunately, our process of virtual resampling relies on us fitting a linear regression for each `rep`licate of our `virtual_resample` dataset. This gets a bit tricky coding wise, as we would need to fit 35 different linear regressions if we had 35 different resamples of our data.\n\nEnter, **infer**, an R package for statistical inference. **infer** makes efficient use of the `%>%` pipe operator we learned in Week 3 to spell out the sequence of steps necessary to perform statistical inference in a \"tidy\" and transparent fashion. Furthermore, just as the **dplyr** package provides functions with verb-like names to perform data wrangling, the **infer** package provides functions with intuitive verb-like names to perform statistical inference.\n\nLet's go back to our original slope. Previously, we computed the value of the sample slope $b_1$ using the `lm()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths_lm <- lm(weight ~ mage, data = births14)\n\nget_regression_table(births_lm)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll see that we can also do this using **infer** functions `specify()` and `calculate()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou might be asking yourself: \"Isn't the **infer** code longer? Why would I use that code?\". While not immediately apparent, you'll see that there are three chief benefits to the **infer** workflow as opposed to the `lm()` function workflow we had previously.\n\nFirst, the **infer** verb names better align with the overall resampling framework you need to understand to construct confidence intervals and to conduct hypothesis tests. We'll see flowchart diagrams of this framework in the upcoming @fig-infer-workflow-ci.\n\nSecond, you can jump back and forth seamlessly between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing with minimal changes to your code. This will become apparent next week, when we also use **infer** to conduct hypothesis tests for the slope statistic.\n\nThird, the **infer** workflow is much simpler for conducting inference when you have *more than one variable*, meaning we can extend what we've learned for simple linear regression to multiple linear regression models.\n\nLet's now illustrate the sequence of verbs necessary to construct a confidence interval for $\\b_1$, the slope of the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight for all US births in 2014.\n\n#### 1. `specify()` variables {#sec-specify}\n\n![\"Diagram of `specify()`ing variables.\"](images/specify.png){#fig-infer-specify}\n\nAs shown in @fig-infer-specify, the `specify()` function is used to choose which variables in a data frame will be the focus of our statistical inference. We do this by `specify`ing the `response` argument. For example, in our `births14` data frame, the response variable of interest is `weight` and the explanatory variable is `mage`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   weight  mage\n    <dbl> <dbl>\n 1   6.96    34\n 2   8.86    31\n 3   7.51    36\n 4   6.19    16\n 5   6.75    31\n 6   6.69    26\n 7   6.13    36\n 8   6.74    24\n 9   8.94    32\n10   9.12    26\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice how the dataset got smaller, now there are only two columns where before there were 14. You should also notice the messages above the dataset (`Response: weight (numeric)` and `Explanatory: mage`). These are *meta-data* about the grouping structure of the dataset, declaring which variable has been assigned to the explanatory / response.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis is similar to how the `group_by()` verb from `dplyr` doesn't change the data, but only adds \"grouping\" meta-data, as we saw in Week 3.\n:::\n\n#### 2. `generate()` replicates {#sec-generate}\n\n![\"Diagram of `generate()` replicates.\"](images/generate.png){#fig-infer-generate}\n\nAfter we `specify()` the variables of interest, we pipe the results into the `generate()` function to generate replicates. @fig-infer-generate shows how this is combined with `specify()` to start the pipeline. In other words, repeat the resampling process a large number of times, similar to how we collected 35 different samples of balls from the bowl.\n\nThe `generate()` function's first argument is `reps`, which sets the number of replicates we would like to generate. Suppose we were interested in obtaining 50 different resamples (each of 1,000 birth records). Then, we would we set `reps = 50`, telling **infer** that we are interested in obtaining 50 different resamples, each with 1,000 observations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe second argument `type` determines the type of computer simulation we'd like to perform. We set this to `type = \"bootstrap\"` indicating that we want to perform bootstrap resampling, meaning the resampling should be done *with replacement*. You'll see different options for `type` when we learn about hypothesis testing next week.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  generate(reps = 50, \n           type = \"bootstrap\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 50,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [50]\n   replicate weight  mage\n       <int>  <dbl> <dbl>\n 1         1  10.6     31\n 2         1   4.31    31\n 3         1   4.94    33\n 4         1   5.65    36\n 5         1   8       23\n 6         1   7.63    37\n 7         1   8       19\n 8         1   3.22    30\n 9         1   8.56    32\n10         1   4.32    21\n# ℹ 49,990 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nObserve that the resulting data frame has 50,000 rows. This is because we performed resampling of 1000 birth records with replacement 50 times and 1000 $\\times$ 50 = 50,000.\n\nThe variable `replicate` indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value `1` 1000 times, the value `2` 1000 times, all the way through to the value 50 1000 times.\n\n**Comparing with original workflow**: Note that the steps of the **infer** workflow so far produce the same results as the original workflow using the `rep_sample_n()` function we saw earlier. In other words, the following two code chunks produce similar results:\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n**infer** workflow\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths14 %>%\n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  generate(reps = 50, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") \n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\nOriginal workflow\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep_sample_n(births14, \n             size = 1000, \n             replace = TRUE,\n             reps = 50)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n#### 3. `calculate()` summary statistics {#sec-calculate}\n\n![Diagram of calculate()d summary statistics.](images/calculate.png){#fig-calculate}\n\nAfter we `generate()` many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize each of the 50 resamples of size 1000 to a single sample statistic value. As seen in @fig-calculate, the `calculate()` function does this.\n\nIn our case, we want to calculate the slope between mother's age and baby's birth weight for each bootstrap resample of size 1000. To do so, we set the `stat` argument to `\"slope\"`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou can also set the `stat` argument to a variety of other common summary statistics, like `\"median\"`, `\"sum\"`, `\"sd\"` (standard deviation), and `\"prop\"` (proportion). To see a list of all possible summary statistics you can use, type `?calculate` and read the help file.\n:::\n\nLet's save the result in a data frame called `bootstrap_distribution` and explore its contents:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_distribution <- births14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  generate(reps = 50) %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nbootstrap_distribution\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 50 × 2\n   replicate    stat\n       <int>   <dbl>\n 1         1 0.0328 \n 2         2 0.0181 \n 3         3 0.0123 \n 4         4 0.0106 \n 5         5 0.0183 \n 6         6 0.0190 \n 7         7 0.0145 \n 8         8 0.00824\n 9         9 0.0155 \n10        10 0.0160 \n# ℹ 40 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nObserve that the resulting data frame has 50 rows and two columns. The `replicate` column corresponds to the 50 replicates and the `stat` column corresponds to the estimated slope for each resample.\n\n#### 4. `visualize()` the results {.unnumbered}\n\n![Diagram of closing the entire process by visualize()ing the results.](images/visualize.png){#fig-visualize}\n\nThe `visualize()`verb provides a quick way to visualize the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the numerical `stat` variable's values. The pipeline of the main **infer** verbs used for exploring bootstrap distribution results is shown in @fig-infer-visualize.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(bootstrap_distribution)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bootstrap distribution of slope statistics from 50 bootstrap resamples.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-infer-visualize-1.png){#fig-infer-visualize width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe `visualize()` function can take many other arguments which we'll see momentarily to customize the plot further. It also works with helper functions to do the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values.\n:::\n\n**Comparing with original workflow**: In fact, `visualize()` is a *wrapper function* for the `ggplot()` function that uses a `geom_histogram()` layer. That's a lot of fancy language which means that the `visualize()` function does the **same** thing as we did previously with `ggplot()`, just with fewer steps.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n**infer** workflow\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(bootstrap_distribution)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nOriginal workflow\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bootstrap_distribution,\n       mapping = aes(x = stat)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\nCareful! It might sound tempting to ditch the `ggplot()` code altogether now that you know of a simpler approach. The `visualize()` function only works for a specific case -- a data frame containing a distribution of `calculate()`d statistics.\n:::\n\nLet's recap the steps of the **infer** workflow for constructing a bootstrap distribution and then visualizing it in @fig-infer-workflow-ci.\n\n![infer package workflow for resampling](images/ci_diagram.png){#fig-infer-workflow-ci}\n\n### Virtually resampling 1,000 times\n\nTo change from resampling 50 times to resampling 1,000 times, only one line of code needs to change---the number of `reps`. In the code process below, we've chained together the entire **infer** pipeline, connecting the specify, generate, calculate, and visualize steps.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_1000 <- births14 |> \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) |> \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") |> \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\") \n\nvisualize(bootstrap_1000) + \n  labs(x = \"Bootstrap Slope Statistic\", \n       y = \"Bootstrap Distribution of 1,000 Resamples\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bootstrap distribution with 1,000 replicates.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-infer-1000-1.png){#fig-infer-1000 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n# Changing axis labels\n\nNotice you can still use the `labs()` function to change your axis labels. Notice that you still need to connect the axis labels with the plot using a `+` sign.\n:::\n\nWhat do you notice about this distribution? What distribution does it resemble? Why is that the case?\n\n### Connection to sampling distributions\n\nThe histogram of sample slopes in @fig-infer-1000 is called the **bootstrap distribution**. The bootstrap distribution is an *approximation* to the sampling distribution of sample slopes.\n\nIf you recall back to the last chapter, a sampling distribution was a distribution of statistics from repeatedly *sampling* from the **population**. However, a bootstrap distribution is a distribution of statistics from repeatedly *resampling* from the **sample**. This may seem rather strange, how can a distribution based entirely on the sample approximate a distribution based on the population? That's a great question!\n\nThe bootstrapping process hinges on the belief that the sample is representative of the population. Meaning, there are not systematic differences between the sample and the population. For example, if there were no young mothers in the sample of 1,000 birth records in the `births14` dataset. If we have a random sample, however, then on average our sample should look very similar to our population. Meaning, the individuals in the sample can \"stand in\" for individuals in the population with similar characteristics. So, we can think of repeatedly *resampling* from our sample as a similar process as sampling from the population.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n### No guaranteed representation\n\nThe process of randomly sampling **does not** guarantee that smaller groups of observations will *always* appear in the sample. Rather, by randomly sampling from the population, on average the representation of individuals in the sample should reflect the proportion of individuals in the population.\n\nTo me, this feels rather uncomfortable as a random sample assumes that you can generalize from the sample onto the population from which it was drawn. This means you are generalizing the observations of a few individuals onto the entire population of similar individuals. For example, if you were to collect a random sample of Cal Poly students, it is likely your sample would include very few Black students (as Cal Poly is a predominantly white institution). But, if your sample was random, statistically you could infer from your small sample of Black students onto the entire population of Black students at Cal Poly. That seems kind of iffy to me.\n:::\n\n## Understanding confidence intervals {#sec-understanding}\n\nLet's start this section with an analogy involving fishing. Say you are trying to catch a fish. On the one hand, you could use a spear, while on the other you could use a net. Using the net will probably allow you to catch more fish!\n\nIn the `births14` investigation, we are trying to estimate the population slope for the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight ($\\beta_1$) for **all** babies born in the US in 2014. Think of the value of $\\beta_1$ as a fish.\n\nOn the one hand, we could use the appropriate *point estimate/sample statistic* to estimate $\\beta_1$, which we saw in @tbl-births-slr is the sample slope $b_1$. Based on our sample of 1000 birth records, the sample slope was 0.014. Think of using this value as \"fishing with a spear.\"\n\nWhat would \"fishing with a net\" correspond to? Look at the bootstrap distribution in @fig-infer-1000 once more. Between which values would you say that \"most\" sample slopes lie? While this question is somewhat subjective, saying that most sample slopes lie between 0 and 0.03 would not be unreasonable. Think of this interval as the \"net.\"\n\nWhat we've just illustrated is the concept of a *confidence interval*, which I'll abbreviate with \"CI\" throughout this chapter. As opposed to a point estimate / sample statistic that estimates the value of an unknown population parameter with a single value, a *confidence interval* gives what can be interpreted as a range of plausible values. Going back to our analogy, point estimates / sample statistics can be thought of as spears, whereas confidence intervals can be thought of as nets.\n\n![Analogy of difference between point estimates and confidence intervals.](images/point_estimate_vs_conf_int.png){#fig-spear-net}\n\nOur proposed interval of 0 to 0.03 was constructed by eye and was thus somewhat subjective. We now introduce two methods for constructing such intervals in a more exact fashion: the *percentile method* and the *standard error method*.\n\nBoth methods for confidence interval construction share some commonalities. First, they are both constructed from a bootstrap distribution, as you constructed in the previous section and visualized in @fig-infer-1000.\n\nSecond, they both require you to specify the *confidence level*. Commonly used confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%. All other things being equal, higher confidence levels correspond to wider confidence intervals, and lower confidence levels correspond to narrower confidence intervals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Percentile method {#sec-percentile-method}\n\nOne method to construct a 95% confidence interval is to use the middle 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution. We can do this by computing the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, which are 0.0002 and 0.0281, respectively. This is known as the *percentile method* for constructing confidence intervals.\n\nFor now, let's focus only on the concepts behind a percentile method constructed confidence interval; we'll show you the code that computes these values in the next section.\n\nLet's mark these percentiles on the bootstrap distribution with vertical lines in @fig-percentile-method. About 95% of the `slope` variable values in `bootstrap_1000` fall between 0.0002 and 0.0281, with 2.5% to the left of the leftmost line and 2.5% to the right of the rightmost line.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentile method 95% confidence interval. Interval endpoints marked by vertical lines.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-percentile-method-1.png){#fig-percentile-method width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Standard error method {#sec-se-method}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nRecall in the last chapter we saw that if a numerical variable follows a normal distribution, or, in other words, the histogram of this variable is bell-shaped, then roughly 95% of values fall between $\\pm$ 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Given that our bootstrap distribution based on 1000 resamples with replacement in @fig-infer-1000 is normally shaped, let's use this fact about normal distributions to construct a confidence interval in a different way.\n\nFirst, recall the bootstrap distribution has a mean equal to 0.014. This value almost coincides exactly with the value of the sample slope $b_1$ of our original 1000 birth records 0.014. Second, let's compute the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution using the bootstrap slope statistics stored in the `stat` column of the `bootstrap_1000` data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_1000 %>% \n  summarize(SE = sd(stat))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n       SE\n    <dbl>\n1 0.00722\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat is this value? Recall that the bootstrap distribution is an approximation to the sampling distribution. Thus, the variability of the sampling distribution may be approximated by the variability of the resampling distribution. Recall also that the standard deviation of a sampling distribution has a special name: the *standard error*. Putting these two facts together, we can say that 0.00722 is an approximation of the standard error of $b_1$.\n\nTraditional theory-based methodologies for inference also have formulas for standard errors, assuming some conditions are not violated. In this method, we are not using a formula to get our standard error, but using the standard error of the bootstrap distribution. Thus, using our 95% rule of thumb about normal distributions, we can use the following formula to determine the lower and upper endpoints of a 95% confidence interval for $\\beta_1$:\n\n$$\nb_1 \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = (b_1 - 1.96 \\times SE, b_1 + 1.96 \\times SE)\n$$\n\n$$\n= (0.014 - 1.96 \\times 0.007, 0.014 + 1.96 \\times 0.007)\n$$\n\n$$\n= (0.00028, 0.02772)\n$$\n\n::: callout-note\nTo use the bootstrap standard error in this formula the bootstrap distribution **must** be bell shaped and symmetric. This is often the case with bootstrap distributions, especially those in which the original distribution of the sample is not highly skewed, however it is not always the case. Next week, we'll go deeper into the explorations of model conditions.\n:::\n\nLet's now add the SE method confidence interval with dashed lines in @fig-percentile-and-se-method.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparing two 95% confidence interval methods.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-percentile-and-se-method-1.png){#fig-percentile-and-se-method width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that both methods produce nearly identical 95% confidence intervals for $\\beta_1$ with the percentile method yielding $(0.0002, 0.0281)$ while the standard error method produces $(0.0001, 0.0284)$.\n\nNow that we've introduced the concept of confidence intervals and laid out the intuition behind two methods for constructing them, let's explore the code that allows us to construct them.\n\n## Constructing confidence intervals\n\nNow that we've covered two methods for obtaining confidence intervals, let's now check out the **infer** package code that explicitly constructs these. There are also some additional neat functions to visualize the resulting confidence intervals built-in to the **infer** package!\n\n#### Percentile method with **infer** {#sec-percentile-infer}\n\nRecall the percentile method for constructing 95% confidence intervals we introduced in @sec-percentile-method. This method sets the lower endpoint of the confidence interval at the 2.5th percentile of the bootstrap distribution and similarly sets the upper endpoint at the 97.5th percentile. The resulting interval captures the middle 95% of the values of the sample mean in the bootstrap distribution.\n\nWe can compute the 95% confidence interval using the `get_confidence_interval()` function function from the `infer` package. This function takes three arguments (inputs):\n\n-   a data frame containing `calculate()`d statistics (e.g., slope statistics)\n-   a confidence `level` (e.g., 0.95 or 0.99)\n-   the `type` of interval to be made -- `\"percentile\"` or `\"se\"`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npercentile_ci <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distribution, \n                                         level = 0.95, \n                                         type = \"percentile\")\npercentile_ci\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower_ci upper_ci\n     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 -0.00185   0.0285\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, we can visualize this interval by adding a `shade_confidence_interval()` layer to the `visualize()` step. This step requires the `endpoints` of the interval to be specified, so the previous step **must** come *before* the following step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(bootstrap_1000) + \n  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentile method 95% confidence interval shaded corresponding to potential values.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-percentile-ci-viz-1.png){#fig-percentile-ci-viz width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nObserve in @fig-percentile-ci-viz that 95% of the sample slopes stored in the `stat` variable in `bootstrap_1000` fall between the two endpoints marked with the darker lines, with 2.5% of the sample means to the left of the shaded area and 2.5% of the sample means to the right.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe default colors for `shade_confidence_interval()` are `color = \"mediumaquamarine\"` and `fill = \"turquoise\"`. You can, however, change these colors if you wish!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(bootstrap_distribution) + \n  shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, color = \"hotpink\", fill = \"khaki\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### Standard error method with `infer` {#sec-se-infer}\n\nRecall the standard error method for constructing 95% confidence intervals we introduced in @sec-se-method. From properties of the Normal Distribution, we know that for any distribution that is bell shaped and symmetric, roughly 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Recall that in the case of the sampling distribution, the standard deviation has a special name: the *standard error*. Moreover, remember that the bootstrap distribution provides us with a robust estimate of the standard error of the sampling distribution.\n\nSo in our case, 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution will lie within $\\pm 1.96$ standard errors of $b_1$. Thus, a 95% confidence interval is\n\n$$\nb_a \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = (b_1 - 1.96 \\times SE, b_1 + 1.96 \\times SE)\n$$\n\nComputation of the 95% confidence interval can once again be done by inputting the the `bootstrap_1000` data frame we created into the `get_confidence_interval()` function, using roughly the same code as before. There are two components, however, that must change:\n\n-   we need to set the `type` argument to be `\"se\"`\n-   we need to specify where the confidence interval should be centered -- the `point_estimate`\n\nTo calculate the point estimate, we need one additional step **before** calculating our confidence interval. Rather than using the output from the `lm()` function like we did in @tbl-births-slr, let's obtain our observed slope statistic using the infer pipeline! This process should look familiar, in fact the only part that has changed is we no longer have a `generate()` step. We are not generating any resamples, so that step is no longer needed. All we need to do is `specify()` our variables and `calculate()` the `\"slope\"` statistic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobs_slope <- births14 |> \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) |> \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nstandard_error_ci <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000, \n                                             type = \"se\", \n                                             point_estimate = obs_slope, \n                                             level = 0.95)\nstandard_error_ci\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   lower_ci upper_ci\n      <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 0.0000947   0.0284\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we would like to visualize this interval, we can once again add a `shade_confidence_interval()` layer to our plot.

The effectiveness of a confidence interval is judged by whether or not it contains the true value of the population parameter. Going back to our fishing analogy in @sec-understanding, this is like asking, \"Did our net capture the fish?\".\n\nSo, for example, does our percentile-based confidence interval of (-0.0018, 0.0285) \"capture\" the slope of the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight ($\\beta_1$) for *all* babies born in the US in 2014? Alas, we'll never know, because we don't know what the true value of $\\beta_1$ is. After all, we're sampling to estimate it!\n\nIn order to interpret a confidence interval's effectiveness, we need to *know* what the value of the population parameter is. That way we can say whether or not a confidence interval \"captured\" this value. In the case of `births14` dataset, we have the ability to go find the original dataset, housing the birth records of every baby born in the US in 2014. I did so, and found that the slope for the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight ($\\beta_1$) for *all* babies born in the US in 2014 was $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$.\n\n### Did our interval(s) capture $\\beta_1$?\n\nNow that we know the value of $\\beta_1$, we can see if the intervals we constructed previously do in fact contain this parameter. The percentile interval of (-0.0018, 0.0285) contains $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$ and the SE interval of 0.0001, 0.0284) also contains $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$. Will our 95% confidence intervals *always* contain $\\beta_1$? Let's see!\n\n### Constructing more intervals\n\nLet's construct 50 more confidence intervals for $\\beta_1$ using the infer workflow we learned before. We can then compare how many of these confidence intervals \"captured\" the true value of $\\beta_1$, which we know to be 0.0007. That is to say, \"Did the net capture the fish?\".\n\nIn the code below, we create a second bootstrap distribution, also with 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Then, using this second bootstrap distribution, we use the percentile method to calculate a 95% confidence interval.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Choice of method\n\nI've chosen to use the percentile method as we saw that the intervals had similar results and the percentile method has fewer steps. So, I'm choosing to be efficient! However, since we saw the bootstrap distribution was bell shaped and symmetric, either method would work.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_1000_v2 <- births14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n  \npercentile_ci_2 <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000_v2, \n                                         level = 0.95)\npercentile_ci_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n    lower_ci upper_ci\n       <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 -0.0000326   0.0285\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice this interval, also contains $\\beta_1$. Let's do this again...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_1000_v3 <- births14 %>% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n  \npercentile_ci_3 <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000_v3, \n                                         level = 0.95)\npercentile_ci_3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   lower_ci upper_ci\n      <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 -0.000133   0.0285\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAgain, our interval contains $\\beta_1$. Let's scale this up and look at 50 different intervals constructed using this method. @fig-50-intervals visualizes these 50 intervals, where:\n\n-   the true value of $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$ is marked with a red, vertical line\n-   each of the intervals is marked with a horizontal line\n\nIf the interval contained $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$, the line is colored grey. If the interval **did not** contain $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$, the line is colored black.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![50 percentile-based 95% confidence intervals for the true slope for the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight, for all babies born in the US in 2014.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-50-intervals-1.png){#fig-50-intervals width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf the 50 95% confidence intervals, 46 of them captured the true value of $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$, whereas 4 of them didn't. In other words, 46 of our nets caught the fish, and 4 of our nets didn't.\n\nThis is where the \"95% confidence level\" comes into play: for every 50 95% confidence intervals constructed, we expect that about 95% of them will capture $\\beta_1$ and 5% of them won't. That's a bit tricky for 50, as 95% of 50 is 47.5. Technically, we can only have either 47 or 48 intervals contain $\\beta_1$, but this should reinforce that the process is not exact. We will not always get 95% of the intervals containing $\\beta_1$, but on average we expect that 95% of them should.\n\n### Connection to the empiracle rule\n\nYou might wonder, why do only 5% of the 95% confidence intervals miss the parameter they are estimating. This reasoning goes back to what you read on the empiracle rule for bell-shaped and symmetric curves. Namely, the rule of thumb that 95% of values will lie within approximately 2 standard deviations of the center of the distribution. The center of a sampling distribution is the value of the parameter. For our example, this value is $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$, the value of the slope for the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight for all babies born in the US in 2014.\n\n@fig-normal-rule-of-thumb displays the sampling distribution of $b_1$, centered at $\\beta_1 = 0.0007$. Because our sampling distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, we know that 95% of the slope statistics should fall within 2 standard errors of the center, as noted by the two dashed lines. That means, only 5% of the slope statistics should fall *outside* this interval. Our sample slope statistic ($b_1$) is **always** the center of our confidence interval. So, if our sample slope statistic is greater than 2 standard deviations from the center of the sampling distribution, its confidence interval **will not** contain $\\beta_1$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rules of thumb about areas under normal curves.](week7-reading2_files/figure-html/fig-normal-rule-of-thumb-1.png){#fig-normal-rule-of-thumb width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Precise and shorthand interpretation\n\nLet's return our attention to 95% confidence intervals. The precise and mathematically correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is a little long-winded:\n\n> Precise interpretation: If we repeated our sampling procedure a large number of times, we expect about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.\n\nThis is what we observed in @fig-50-intervals. Our confidence interval construction procedure is 95% *reliable*. That is to say, we can expect our confidence intervals to include the true population parameter about 95% of the time.\n\nA common but incorrect interpretation is: \"There is a 95% probability that the confidence interval contains $\\beta_1$.\" Looking at @fig-50-intervals, each of the confidence intervals either does or doesn't contain $\\beta_1$. In other words, the probability is either 100% or 0%.\n\nSo if the 95% confidence level only relates to the reliability of the confidence interval construction procedure and not to a given confidence interval itself, what insight can be derived from a given confidence interval? Loosely speaking, we can think of these intervals as our \"best guess\" of a plausible range of values for the slope of the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight $\\beta_1$ of *all* babies born in the US in 2014. It is typical to use the following shorthand summary of the precise interpretation:\n\n> We are 95% \"confident\" that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter. We use quotation marks around \"confident\" to emphasize that while 95% relates to the reliability of our confidence interval construction procedure, ultimately a constructed confidence interval is our best guess of an interval that contains the population parameter. In other words, it's our best net.\n\nSo returning to the first confidence interval we calculated, we would interpret this interval as \"We are 95% 'confident' that the slope of the relationship between mother's age and baby's birth weight $\\beta_1$ of *all* babies born in the US in 2014 is between -0.0018 and 0.0285.\n\n### Width of confidence intervals {#ci-width}\n\nNow that we know how to interpret confidence intervals, let's go over some factors that determine their width.\n\n#### Impact of confidence level\n\nOne factor that determines confidence interval widths is the pre-specified confidence level. For example, we used 95% confidence intervals for this reading, but we could have equally chosen 85% intervals. A 95% confidence interval created using the percentile method contains 95% of the values in the bootstrap distribution. An 85% confidence interval would only contain 85% of these values, so it would be a **narrower** confidence interval. The quantification of the confidence level should match what many expect of the word \"confident.\" In order to be more confident in our best guess of a range of values, we need to widen the range of values.\n\nTo elaborate on this, imagine we want to guess the forecasted high temperature in Seoul, South Korea on August 15th. Given Seoul's temperate climate with four distinct seasons, we could say somewhat confidently that the high temperature would be between 50°F - 95°F (10°C - 35°C). However, if we wanted a temperature range we were *absolutely* confident about, we would need to widen it.\n\nWe need this wider range to allow for the possibility of anomalous weather, like a freak cold spell or an extreme heat wave. So a range of temperatures we could be near certain about would be between 32°F - 110°F (0°C - 43°C). On the other hand, if we could tolerate being a little less confident, we could narrow this range to between 70°F - 85°F (21°C - 30°C).\n\nSo in order to have a higher confidence level, our confidence intervals must be wider. Ideally, we would have both a high confidence level and narrow confidence intervals. However, we cannot have it both ways. If we want to be more confident, we need to allow for wider intervals. Conversely, if we would like a narrow interval, we must tolerate a lower confidence level.\n\n> The moral of the story is: Higher confidence levels tend to produce wider confidence intervals.\n\n#### Impact of sample size\n\nPulling from what we learned about the *Central Limit Theorem* at the end of the last reading, we know that variability decreases when sample size increases. We quantified the sampling variation of these sampling distributions using their standard deviation, which has that special name: the standard error. So as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases.\n\nConnecting to what you learned in this reading, if we have a large sample size, the spread of the bootstrap distribution will be smaller, which in turn leads to smaller estimated standard errors, and narrower confidence intervals. In @sec-se-method you saw directly how the standard error is used when calculating a confidence interval.\n",
