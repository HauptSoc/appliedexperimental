We are going to explore *multiple linear regression*, a statistical model where we have multiple explanatory variables and a single numerical response. We are going to refresh how to visualize these types of models, practice fitting these types of models in `R`, and the learn how to interpret these types of models.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this coursework you should be able to:\n\n-   describe to someone what a multiple linear regression is\n-   outline how a categorical explanatory variable can be included in a simple linear regression\n-   visualize multiple linear regression models with one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable\n-   calculate the simple linear regression line for each group of a categorical variable\n-   outline how a second numerical explanatory variable can be included in a simple linear regression\n-   visualize multiple linear regression models with two numerical explanatory variables\n-   interpret the coefficient of each explanatory variable included in the regression model\n-   recite different methods that can be used to decide what multiple linear regression model is \"best\"\n-   describe the benefits and costs of using \"model selection\" for deciding on a multiple linear regression model\n\n# Prepare\n\n## Textbook Reading\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column

-- We interpret the value of -0.003 by age as:\n\nFor every \\[1 day / 1 year / 1 evaluation\\] increase in professor's \\[evaluation score / age / average beauty\\] we expect the \\[course evaluation
