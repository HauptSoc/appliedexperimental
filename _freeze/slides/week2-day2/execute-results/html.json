Then, use these group patterns (such as averages and other statistics) to analyze and model individuals. The science of the individual instead instructs scientists to analyze, then aggregate: First, look for pattern within each individual. Then, look for ways to combine these individual patterns into collective insight.\n\nThe End of Average Todd Rose\n\nclass: center, middle, inverse\n\n.larger[What else then?]\n\nIf you could not use averages to evaluate, model, and select individuals, well then…what could you use?\n\nThis practical retort underscores the reason that averagarianism has endured for so long and become so deeply ingrained throughout society.\n\n.larger[\"We've always done it this way\"]\n\n</br> </br>\n\nMethods based on averages are available, easy, convenient, and take little creativity — and they are expected in our scientific culture.\n\nJustification for using averages is simply not demanded — though justification for use of anything but averages is incredibly difficult to sell.\n\nclass: center, inverse\n\n.larger[Some Rules to Play By]\n\n</br>\n\n–\n\n.large[Look at and understand your raw data before aggregating]\n\n–\n\n.large[Boxplots (and such) don't count as visualizing the raw data.]\n\n–\n\n.large[We should only average things we are convinced are measuring the same thing.]",
