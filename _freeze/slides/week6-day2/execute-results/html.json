The assignment portal closes at 11:59pm on Sunday. \n**Do not ride the line. Submissions made after 11:59pm will not be accepted.**\n:::\n\n# Midterm Project Review\n\n## Data Descriptions\n\nYour Introduction should **at a minimum** address the following questions:\n\n1. Who collected the data?\n2. How were the data collected?\n3. When were the data collected?\n3. Why were the data collected? \n4. What question do these data address? \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Are your data associated with a publication?\n\nIf so, you should have a reference to this publication in your Introduction!\n:::\n\n## Research Questions\n\n::: incremental\n-   Your research question should be a [question]{.underline}\n\n-   Your question should be able to be addressed with a [multiple linear regression]{.underline}\n\n    -   Is the relationship between stem length and stem dry mass different for watersheds treated with calcium versus without?\n    -   Is there a relationship between the elevation a pika lives and its stress levels? Does this relationship differ for male and female pika?\n:::\n\n## Variables\n\n> Describe the response and explanatory variables, how they were measured and\ntheir associated units. \n\n::: {.incremental}\n- How were the variables measured? \n  * How do you know?\n  * If the researchers do not explicitly state how a variable was measured, \n  don't guess! Be transparent about information you do not know!\n:::\n\n## Data Visualizations & Coefficient Interpretations\n\n::: incremental\n-   Descriptions of your visualizations should address:\n\n    -   form, direction, strength, and unusual points\n\n-   Descriptions of your visualizations should go **immediately below** the visualization, *before* the \"Statistical Methods\" subsection.\n:::\n\n## Study Limitations -- Scope of Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what population can you infer these results onto?\n\n:::: fragment\n::: small\n-   Every penguin?\n-   Penguins in Antarctica?\n-   Penguins on the Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen islands?\n-   Penguins in similar areas to those that were sampled?\n-   This sample of penguins?\n:::\n::::\n\n## Study Limitations -- Scope of Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what population can you infer these results onto?\n\n::: small\n**Justify** what population you believe your analysis can be inferred onto.\n\n-   The sample of \\[possums / professors / crabs\\]?\n-   Some larger population of \\[possums / professors / crabs\\]?\n\nYour justification needs to connect with how the researchers collected their data!\n:::\n\n## Study Limitations -- Causal Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what can you say about the relationships between the variables?\n\n</br> \n\n:::: fragment\n::: small\n-   Can you say that your explanatory variable(s) [causes]{.underline} changes in your response variable?\n-   Why or why not?\n-   What can you say about these relationships?\n:::\n::::\n\n## Study Limitations -- Causal Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what can you say about the relationships between the variables?\n\n</br> \n\n::: small\nStating that the study was \"observational\" doesn't tell me that you understand what would be required to use cause-and-effect language!\n\n-   What **specifically** would have the researchers have needed to do in order to use causal language?\n:::\n\n## Writing Conclusions\n\n-   Circle back to your research question\n-   What did you learn in your visualizations?\n-   What did you learn in your regression model?\n-   What conclusions would you reach about your research question?\n\n::: callout-caution\n# No \"significance\" & no p-values\n:::\n\n# Model Selection\n\n# Lab 6\n\n## Forward Selection (by Hand)\n\n1.  Start with the most basic model (one mean)\n\n2.  Decide which **one** variable to add (based on adjusted $R^2$)\n\n3.  Decide if you should add another variable\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n4.  Stop adding variables when adjusted $R^2$ stops increasing\n\n## A More Automated Option\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"|2,6,7\"}\nevals_train %>% \n  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + <VARIABLES SELECTED>, data = evals_train)) %>% \n  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %>% \n  select(-ID, \n         -score,\n         -<VARIABLE 1 SELECTED>,\n         -<VARIABLE 2 SELECTED>\n         ) %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"variable\", \n               values_to = \"adj_r_sq\") %>% \n  slice_max(adj_r_sq)\n```\n:::\n",
