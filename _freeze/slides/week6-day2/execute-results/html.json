The assignment portal closes at 11:59pm on Sunday. \n**Do not ride the line. Submissions made after 11:59pm will not be accepted.**\n:::\n\n# Midterm Project Review\n\n# Midterm Project\n\n## Research Questions\n\n::: incremental\n-   Your research question should be a [question]{.underline}\n\n-   Your question should be able to be addressed with a [multiple linear regression]{.underline}\n\n    -   Is the relationship between stem length and stem dry mass different for watersheds treated with calcium versus without?\n    -   Is there a relationship between the elevation a pika lives and its stress levels? Does this relationship differ for male and female pika?\n:::\n\n## Data Visualizations & Coefficient Interpretations\n\n::: incremental\n-   Descriptions of your visualizations should address:\n\n    -   form, direction, strength, and unusual points\n\n-   Descriptions of your visualizations should go **immediately below** the visualization, *before* the \"Proposed Statistical Model\" section\n\n-   You should interpret **every** coefficient from your regression equation(s)!\n\n    -   Every y-intercept and every slope\n:::\n\n## Study Limitations -- Scope of Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what population can you infer these results onto?\n\n:::: fragment\n::: small\n-   Every sugar maple?\n-   Sugar maples in the Northeast?\n-   Sugar maples in New Hampshire?\n-   Sugar maples in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest?\n-   Sugar maples in similar areas of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to those that were sampled?\n-   This sample of sugar maples?\n:::\n::::\n\n. . .\n\nWhy?\n\n## Study Limitations -- Causal Inference\n\nBased on how the study was designed, what can you say about the relationships between the variables?\n\n:::: fragment\n::: small\n-   Can you say that your explanatory variable(s) [causes]{.underline} changes in your response variable?\n-   Why or why not?\n-   What can you say about these relationships?\n:::\n::::\n\n## Writing Conclusions\n\n-   Circle back to your research question\n-   What did you learn in your visualizations?\n-   What did you learn in your regression model?\n-   What conclusions would you reach about your research question?\n\n::: callout-caution\n# No \"significance\" & no p-values\n:::\n\n\n## Help your peers!\n\n-   Are the arguments / sentences easy to understand? Does the report flow?\n\n-   Is the same information included in multiple places?\n\n-   Do the plots have nice axis labels?\n\n-   Can you easily find the regression equations? Do the equations make sense?\n\n-   Do the interpretations / conclusions from the equations make sense?\n\n# Peer Feedback\n\n# Study Limitations\n\n## Based on how the study was designed, what population can you infer these results onto?\n\n. . .\n\n</br>\n\n**Justify** what population you believe your analysis can be inferred onto.\n\n-   The sample of \\[possums / professors / crabs\\]?\n-   Some larger population of \\[possums / professors / crabs\\]?\n\nYour justification needs to connect with how the researchers collected their data!\n\n## Based on how the study was designed, what can you say about the relationships between the variables?\n\n</br>\n\n. . .\n\nStating that the study was \"observational\" doesn't tell me that you understand what would be required to use cause-and-effect language!\n\n-   What **specifically** would have the researchers have needed to do in order to use causal language?\n\n\n# Lab 6\n\n## Forward Selection (by Hand)\n\n1.  Start with the most basic model (one mean)\n\n2.  Decide which **one** variable to add (based on adjusted $R^2$)\n\n3.  Decide if you should add another variable\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n4.  Stop adding variables when adjusted $R^2$ stops increasing\n\n## A More Automated Option\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"|2,6,7\"}\nevals_train %>% \n  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + <VARIABLES SELECTED>, data = evals_train)) %>% \n  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %>% \n  select(-ID, \n         -score,\n         -<VARIABLE 1 SELECTED>,\n         -<VARIABLE 2 SELECTED>\n         ) %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"variable\", \n               values_to = \"adj_r_sq\") %>% \n  slice_max(adj_r_sq)\n```\n:::\n",
