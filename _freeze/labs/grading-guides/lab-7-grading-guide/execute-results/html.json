You were asked to describe the form, direction, strength, and unusual points for the plot. Remember, it is important to explicitly state where you believe the outliers are, so the reader knows where to look!\n\n*If they don't state [where]{.underline} the outlier is*:\n\n> It is important to explicitly state where you believe the outliers are, so the reader knows where to look!\n\n## Question 4\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_correlation(data = pie_crab_clean, \n                formula = latitude ~ water_temp)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobs_slope <- pie_crab_clean %>% \n  specify(response = water_temp, \n          explanatory = latitude) %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 6\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_dist <- pie_crab_clean %>% \n  specify(response = water_temp, \n          explanatory = latitude) %>% \n  generate(reps = 500, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 7\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualise(bootstrap_dist) + \n  labs(x = \"<SOME AXIS LABEL>\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTheir axis label **must** describe what is being plotted (e.g., slope statistics, sample slope, etc.)\n\n*If they did not include an axis label*:\n\n> It is important to include an axis label stating what is being plotted! What is being plotted on this bootstrap distribution?\n\n**If their axis label is not about the slope statistic:**\n\n> What is being plotted in this distribution? What is it a distribution of? What statistics did you calculate in the previous step that are being plotted here?\n\n## Question 8\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_confidence_interval(bootstrap_dist, \n                        level = 0.85)\n```\n:::\n\n\n*If they use a `level` other than 0.85*:\n\n> Look back at the lab instructions, what percentage confidence interval were you asked to construct?\n\n## Question 9\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\nThe interpretation must state:\n\n-   **confidence**: they are 85% confident\n-   **statistic**: the slope between water temperature and latitude\n-   **population**: for all marshes along the eastern US\n-   **interval**: is between \\[lower bound\\] and \\[upper bound\\]\n\n::: callout-note\nNote that every group will get a different interval, due to the randomness of bootstrapping!\n:::\n\n*If they don't state their confidence*:\n\n> How much confidence do you have in your interval?\n\n*If they don't state the statistic in context*:\n\n> We need to be specific about the what parameter we believe is in our interval. What variables is the slope between?\n\n*If they have state an incorrect population*:\n\n> Careful! Are you analyzing data on crabs or on marshes? What population were these 13 marshes drawn from? Where were these marshes located? What population of marshes does your confidence interval apply to?\n\n## Question 10\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_confidence_interval(bootstrap_dist, \n                        level = 0.85, \n                        point_estimate = obs_slope, \n                        type = \"se\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n*If they don't have `type = \"se\"`*:\n\n> What method do you want the function to use when calculating your confidence interval? Percentile intervals are the default!\n\n::: callout-note\nIf they type in the actual number for the estimated slope rather than using the `obs_slope` object, you can give them this reminder:\n\n> It is better practice not to \"hard-code\" numbers in our code, but to reference values stored in objects. This makes our code more resistant to changes in the dataset.\n:::\n\n## Question 11\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   states the intervals are similar\n-   states similarity is due to the normality of the bootstrap distribution\n\n*If they say the intervals are different*:\n\n> Give these intervals another look, yes thier endpoints differ, but how different are they?\n\n*If they don't talk about the bootstrap distribution being approximately normal*:\n\n> What condition do we need to check when using the SE method to construct confidence intervals? Would you say this condition is violated?\n\n## Question 12 (incorrectly labeled 11 again...)\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   states whether they do / do not believe the sample of 13 marshes is representative of all marshes along the eastern US\n-   justifies why using something something that is true?\n\n::: callout-note\nI'm willing to be pretty flexible here, but the key aspect is that they need to **justify** their reasoning.\n:::\n\n*If their justification is about crabs*:\n\n> Careful! Are you analyzing data on crabs or on marshes? The population of marshes you define in #9 is what you should use to assess if the assumption of bootstrapping is reasonable.\n\n*If their justification is not reasonable*:\n\n> Where were these 13 marshes located geographically? Do you believe that these 13 marshes are representative of the broader population they were sampled from?\n\n*If their justification is about the shape of the bootstrap distribution*:\n\n> You are on the right track, we need for the sample to be representative of the population from which it was sampled. However, we cannot assess the representativeness of a sample using a bootstrap distribution. This can only be assessed by inspecting how the data were collected.\n",
