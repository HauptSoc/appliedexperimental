We don't need to make any groups to know how many penguins are in these data! We only need to know the number of rows in the dataset!\n\n*If they use something other than `glimpse()`* or `nrow()`\n\n> Technically, this function doesn't tell you the number of rows / observations in the dataset, which is what we need in order to know the number of crabs in the dataset.\n\n## Question 2\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\nCreates scatterplot with:\n\n-   `latitude` on x-axis\n-   `size` on y-axis\n-   y-axis label includes units for `size` (millimeters)\n\n::: callout-note\nThey are not required to include a regression line, but if they do, great!\n:::\n\n*If they don't have axis labels with the units*:\n\n> It is important to include an axis label stating what the units of each variable are! If you are wondering what the units of crab size are, you can look up the help file (using ?pie_crab)\n\n## Question 3\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\nDescription includes **all** of the following:\n\n-   form of relationship (linear)\n-   direction of relationship (positive)\n-   strength of relationship (moderate)\n-   location of any outliers\n\n*If they forget one of these*:\n\n> Careful! You were asked to describe the form, direction, strength, and unusual points for the plot. Remember, it is important to explicitly state where you believe the outliers are, so the reader knows where to look! I would also encourage you to justify **why** you believe this is an outlier, since other people might not think so!\n\n*If they don't state [where]{.underline} the outlier is*:\n\n> It is important to explicitly state where you believe the outliers are, so the reader knows where to look! I would also encourage you to justify **why** you believe this is an outlier, since other people might not think so!\n\n## Question 4\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobs_slope <- obs_slope <- marsh_info %>% \n  specify(response = size, \n          explanatory = latitude) %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnull_dist <- pie_crab %>% \n  specify(response = size, \n          explanatory = latitude) %>% \n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>% \n  generate(reps = 500, \n           type = \"permute\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf they chose `reps` larger than 500, that's okay!\n\n*If they chose `reps` smaller than 500*:\n\n> Careful! How many resamples (reps) were you asked to generate?\n\n## Question 6\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_p_value(null_dist, \n            obs_stat = obs_slope, \n            direction = \"two-sided\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n*If they don't specify `\"two-sided\"`*:\n\n> Careful! How many tails are there in a \"standard\" hypothesis test for the slope?\n\n## Question 7\n\n**To earn a Success**: States they reject $H_0$ because the p-value is less than 0.1\n\n*If they do not state whether they reject or fail to reject* $H_0$:\n\n> You were asked to make a decision regarding the hypotheses, which has two possible options. Which option do you choose and why?\n\n*If they say they fail to reject* $H_0$:\n\n> Careful! What p-value did you get? Was it smaller than the alpha I specified? The alpha stipulates how \"unusual\" the observed statistic needs to be in order for us to reject the null hypothesis. Is your p-value smaller than this threshold?\n\n## Question 8\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\n-   Conclusion is consistent with your decision\n\n::: callout-note\n# Conclude the null is wrong\n\nIf their conclusion says \"we have evidence against there being no relationship\"\n\n> Careful! Your conclusion tells me what you believe **is not** true about the relationship between these variables. It would be nice if you told me what you believe **is** true!\n:::\n\n*If they made the incorrect decision in Question 7:*\n\n> Your conclusion should change based on your revisions to Question 7. In general, we should always make conclusions in terms of the alternative hypothesis!\n\n*If their conclusion says that there is insufficient evidence that the variables are related:*\n\n> Think back to what the null and alternative hypotheses are for linear regression! If you decided to reject the null, what should you conclude about the relationship between these variables?\n\nIf they conclude there is a positive relationship:\n\n> Think back to what the \"standard\" null and alternative hypotheses are for linear regression! What type of relationship are we testing for?\n\n*If they interpret the p-value but don't make a conclusion:*\n\n> You provided a really great interpretation of what the p-value means, but you have not told me what the p-value would lead you to conclude! What should you conclude about the relationship between these variables?\n\n## Question 9\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_dist <- pie_crab %>% \n  specify(response = size, \n          explanatory = latitude) %>% \n  generate(reps = 500, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf they chose `reps` larger than 500, that's okay!\n\n*If they chose `reps` smaller than 500*:\n\n> Careful! How many resamples (reps) were you asked to generate?\n\n## Question 10\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\nCode should look like the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_confidence_interval(bootstrap_dist, \n                        level = 0.90, \n                        type = \"percentile\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n# `\"percentile\"` is the default\n\nSo, it is okay if they don't specify it!\n:::\n\n*If they use a `level` other than 0.90*:\n\n> Look back at the lab instructions, what percentage confidence interval were you asked to construct?\n\n## Question 11\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\nThe interpretation must state:\n\n-   **confidence**: they are 90% confident\n-   **statistic**: the slope between crab size and latitude\n-   **population**: for all marshes along the eastern US\n-   **interval**: is between \\[lower bound\\] and \\[upper bound\\]\n\n::: callout-note\nNote that every group will get a different interval, due to the randomness of bootstrapping!\n:::\n\n*If they don't state their confidence*:\n\n> How much confidence do you have in your interval?\n\n*If they don't state the statistic in context*:\n\n> We need to be specific about the what parameter we believe is in our interval. The slope statistic is measuring the relationship between which variables?\n\n*If they don't include a population:*\n\n> What population does this interval apply to? Where were these crabs sampled from? That is the population your interval applies to!\n\n<!-- *If they have state an incorrect population*: -->\n\n<!-- > Careful! Are you analyzing data on crabs or on marshes? Where were these marshes located? What population would you characterize these 13 marshes belonging to? That is the population your interval applies to! -->\n\n## Question 12\n\n**To earn a Success**:\n\n-   Say \"yes\" Bergmann's rule applies\n\n-   Because the confidence interval is positive\n\n*If they say \"yes\" because the slope is positive:*\n\n> Technically, it is possible for a slope to be positive but have the confidence interval overlap 0. What values are included in your confidence interval? What does that imply about plausible values for the population slope?\n",
