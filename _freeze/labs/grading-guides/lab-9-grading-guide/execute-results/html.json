What exam? What grade?\n\n## Question 6 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:** compares if distributions of continents move over time or if they stay similar\n\n## Question 7 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   compares observations within a continent\n-   notices countries are recorded multiple times\n-   states the condition is violated\n\n*If they do not state the condition is violated:*\n\n> Look at the observations for Africa! How many observations for Ghana are there? Is it reasonable to assume those observations are independent?\n\n*If they say observations for continents are related in time:*\n\n> Do we have one observation per continent? If not, what are the observations of? Are these observations within a continent related?\n\n## Question 8 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   connects comparison with observations within a year or between continents\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n-   says countries / continents are not related\n-   justifies decision (no)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n-   says countries / continents are related\n-   justifies decision (spatial relationship)\n:::\n:::\n\n*If they do not justify their decision:*\n\n> An essential part of evaluating model conditions is to justify the decisions you make. What was your reasoning for your decision?\n\n## Question 9 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   compares observations between continents\n-   states that a country can only belong to one continent\n-   says condition is not violated\n\n*If they don't discuss how many continents a county can belong to:*\n\n> How many continents can a country belong to? What does that say about between continent independence?\n\n*If they do not justify their decision:*\n\n> An essential part of evaluating model conditions is to justify the decisions you make. What was your reasoning for your decision?\n\n## Question 10 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   compares observations between years\n-   states that observations are related in time\n-   says condition is violated\n\n*If they do not state the condition is violated:*\n\n> Is the observation for Ghana in 2003 related to the observation for Ghana in 2007?\n\n*If they do not justify their decision:*\n\n> An essential part of evaluating model conditions is to justify the decisions you make. What was your reasoning for your decision?\n\n## Question 11 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   discusses the shape of the distributions\n-   says some distributions have more than one mode\n-   says condition is violated\n\n*If they do not state the condition is violated:*\n\n> How many peaks does the Normal distribution have? How many peaks do you see in some of these distributions?\n\n*If they don't make a decision (violated / not):*\n\n> A critical part of evaluation model conditions is to make a decision! Do you feel that this condition is or is not violated?\n\n## Question 12 -- Important!\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   compares the log variances between continents / years\n-   says there are large differences in the log variances\n-   says condition is violated\n\n*If they do not state the condition is violated:*\n\n> How many times larger is the largest variance than the smallest variance? If it is less than 2, they could be similar values, but larger than 2 they start to seem pretty different.\n\n## Question 13\n\n**To earn a Success:** Code should look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naov(grade_8_math_score ~ year, data = math_scores) %>% \n  broom::tidy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n*If they swap* $y$ and $x$:\n\n> Careful! In the lm() function the response goes first!\n\n## Question 14\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   reject $H_0$\n-   state that the p-value was less than 0.1\n\n::: callout-note\n# Fine to not include p-value\n\n*If they don't state what the p-value was:*\n\n> Remember it is important to be transparent with your decision, what p-value did you obtain for this test?\n:::\n\n*If they don't state their* $\\alpha$:\n\n> What alpha was used for your decision?\n\n## Question 15\n\n**To earn a Success:** Conclude at least on year has a different mean grade 8 math score\n\n*If they say all the years have different means:*\n\n> What is the alternative hypothesis for a one-way ANOVA? Is it that all of the years have different means?\n\n## Question 16\n\n**To earn a Success:** Code should look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnull_dist <- math_scores %>%\n  specify(response = grade_8_math_score, explanatory = continent) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 17\n\n**To earn a Success:** Code should look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(null_dist) +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_F, direction = \"greater\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n*If they don't use `\"greater\"` in their direction:*\n\n> Careful! F-statistics can only be positive! What direction should we use to calculate the p-value for statistics that cannot be negative?\n\n## Question 18\n\n**To earn a Success:** Code should look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_p_value(null_dist, \n            obs_stat = obs_F, \n            direction = \"greater\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n*If they don't use `\"greater\"` in their direction:*\n\n> Careful! F-statistics can only be positive! What direction should we use to calculate the p-value for statistics that cannot be negative?\n\n## Question 19\n\n**To earn a Success:**\n\n-   reject $H_0$\n-   state that the p-value was less than 0.1\n\n::: callout-note\n# Fine to not include p-value\n\n*If they don't state what the p-value was:*\n\n> Remember it is important to be transparent with your decision, what p-value did you obtain for this test?\n:::\n\n*If they don't state their* $\\alpha$:\n\n> What alpha was used for your decision?\n\n## Question 20\n\n**To earn a Success:** Conclude at least on continent has a different mean grade 8 math score\n\n*If they say all the continents have different means:*\n\n> What is the alternative hypothesis for a one-way ANOVA? Is it that all of the continents have different means?\n",
