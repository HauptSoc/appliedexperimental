What data types did we say in class that categorical variables can have?\n\n# Question 3 -- Levels of the species variable\n\n**Success**\n\n-   Provides code that uses `distinct()` function\n-   Inputs the `species` variable\n\n**Growing:** Does not use `distinct()` function\n\n*Feedback:* There is a function which finds the *distinct* levels of a categorical variable. What function might that be?\n\n# Question 4 -- Filtering to including only trout\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout <- filter(and_vertebrates, \n                species == \"Cutthroat trout\", \n                length_1_mm > 101)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nThe can use %\\>% or pass in `and_vertebrates` as first argument\n:::\n\n**Growing:** If `filter()` is not correct\n\n-   using the wrong variable / value (e.g., wrong spelling of Cutthroat trout, putting 101 in quotations)\n\n*Feedback for spelling Cutthroat trout incorrectly:* Careful! R is case sensitive, so we need to be sure that we use the same spelling and capitalization the researchers used. How did these researchers spell Cutthroat trout? The output of the `distinct()` function should help you! \n\n*Feedback for using `\"101\"` instead of `101`:* Careful! We use quotations to indicate values of a categorical variable. Is `length_1_mm` a categorical variable?\n\n# Question 5 -- Distribution of trout lengths\n\n**Success**: Acceptable `geom`s:\n\n-   `geom_histogram()`\n-   `geom_density()`\n\n**Growing**:\n\n-   Uses `geom_dotplot()`\n\n*Feedback for using a dotplot:* Careful! A dotplot doesn't automatically resize the dots based on the number of observations you have. This makes it so your dots are running off the page! You can resize the dots using the dotsize argument, with a number smaller than 1 (e.g., 0.5).\n\n-   Uses `geom_boxplot()`\n\n*Feedback for using a boxplot:* For Question 6, we need to use a geom which allows for us to see the *shape* of the distribution. Boxplots hide distributions with multiple modes, so what type of plot would be better?\n\n-   Not including axis label with units (mm)\n\n*Feedback for not including axis labels with units:* Every plot we make should have descriptive axis labels which include the units the variable was measured in. What unit were the length of each trout measured in? \n\n## Question 6 -- Sources of variation\n\n**Success:** Names three \"reasonable\" sources of variation in trout length\n\n**Growing:** Names an unreasonable source of variation in trout lengths\n\n*Feedback:* We are interested in variables that, if changed, we would expect the length of the Cutthroat trout to change. \n\n## Question 7 -- Ridge plot\n\n**Success:** Code should look like the following\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = trout, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  labs(x = \"Length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Channel Section\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:**\n\n-   Doesn't include units (mm) in x-axis label\n\n*Feedback:* It is important for the axis label to contain the units of the variable. What units were the lengths measured in?\n\n-   y-axis should say something about the type of channel\n\n*Feedback:* It is important for the axis label to describe the variable that is being measured. What would be a good y-axis title for what the `unittype` variable measured?\n\n## Question 8 -- Adding another categorical variable\n\n**Success:** Uses either color or facets to incorporate `species`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Option 1 -- Facets\nggplot(data = trout, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n\n## Option 2 -- Colors\nggplot(data = trout, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype, fill = species)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() \n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** If doesn't use facets or colors\n\n::: callout-note\n# Not marking down on axis label\nIf they got a growing on #8 for an axis label, they don't get a growing here.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# If they used `color` instead of `fill`\n\n*Feedback:* The `color` aesthetic only colors the outside of the ridge plot. However, if you were to use the `fill` aesthetic the entire ridge would be filled with color! \n:::\n\n## Question 9 -- Based on the plot, how different are the lengths between the channel types and forest sections?\n\n**Success:** Must have all of the following\n\n-   Comparisons between forest sections (centers, spreads, shapes)\n-   Comparisons between channel types\n-   State what channel types did not have both types of forest\n\n**Growing:**\n\n-   Comparisons are incomplete\n\n*Feedback:* Your comparison of these distributions should include similarities / differences in their centers and shapes.\n\n-   Does not state what channel types did not have both types of forest\n\n*Feedback:* Careful! You should note if not every forest type was observed for every type of channel.\n\n## Question 10 -- Average length of Cutthroat trout between channel types\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout %>%\n  group_by(unittype) %>%\n  summarize(mean_length = mean(length_1_mm))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# If they don't name their summary statistics\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 11, the output of your summary statistics looks a lot nicer if you give them names! (like the example that was given)\n:::\n\n**Growing:** If process is not correct\n\n## Question 11 -- Find the average length of Cutthroat trout between channel types and forest section\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout %>%\n  group_by(unittype, species) %>%\n  summarize(mean_length = mean(length_1_mm))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** If process is not correct\n\n## Question 12 -- Differences in averages compared to plot\n\n**Success:**\n\n-   States that the averages are all fairly similar (comparing the centers)\n-   Connects averages with the skew seen in the visualizations\n\n**Growing:** If all they say is that the differences in means are similar to the visualization\n\n**Feedback:** Note that in Question 11 you are specifically using the mean to summarize the center of the distribution. In Question 8 you saw the shape of each channel / forest section's distribution. Based on what you saw, how do the shapes of the distributions influence the means you are seeing in Question 11?\n",
