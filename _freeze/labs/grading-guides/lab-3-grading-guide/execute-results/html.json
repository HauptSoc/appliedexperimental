What data types did we say in class\nthat categorical variables can have?\n\n# Question 3 -- Levels of the species variable\n\n**Success**\n\n- Provides code that uses `distinct()` function\n- States there are 4 levels: Cutthroat trout, Coastal giant salamander, Olympic\ntorrent salamander, and NA\n\n**Growing:** Does not use `distinct()` function\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 3, there is a function which finds the *distinct* levels\nof a categorical variable. What function might that be?\n\n# Question 4 -- Filtering to including only trout\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout <- filter(and_vertebrates, \n                species == \"Cutthroat trout\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe can use %>% or pass in `and_vertebrates` as first argument\n:::\n\n**Growing:** If `filter()` is not correct\n\n# Question 5 -- Filtering to include only catchable trout\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout <- filter(trout, \n                length_1_mm > 101)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** If `filter()` is not correct \n\n- using `and_vertebrates` \n\n- using the wrong variable / value \n\n- making a new dataset instead of updating the `trout` dataset\n\n*Feedback:* Careful! In Question 5 you were given code that would update the \ntrout dataset, *not* make a new dataset. By making a new dataset, you forgot to \nuse the correct name of the dataset later on! \n\n## Question 6 -- Distribution of trout lengths \n\n**Success**: Acceptable `geom`s:\n\n  * `geom_histogram()`\n  * `geom_dotplot()` (though not great)\n  * `geom_density()` \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nNote: Axis labels are not required! But, if they don't change it, give the \nfollowing feedback:\n\n*For Question 6, it is always nice to have professional looking axis labels!*\n:::\n\n**Growing**: \n\n- Uses `geom_boxplot()`\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 6, we need to use a geom which allows for us to see the *shape* of the distribution. Boxplots hide distributions with multiple modes, so what type of plot would be better?\n\n\n## Question 7 -- Sources of variation\n\n**Success:** Names three \"reasonable\" sources of variation in fish length\n\n**Growing:** Names an unreasonable source of variation in fish lengths\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 7, we are interested in variables that, if changed, we\nwould expect changes in the length of the Cutthroat trout. \n\n## Question 8 -- Ridge plot\n\n**Success:** Code should look like the following\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = fish, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  labs(x = \"Length (mm)\", \n       y = \"Channel Section\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** \n\n- Doesn't change axis labels\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 8, you were asked to give your visualization nice axis\nlabels. Note that means BOTH axes!  \n\n- Doesn't include units (mm) in x-axis label\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 8, it is important for the axis label to contain the\nunits of the variable. What units were the lengths measured in?\n\n- Y-axis should say something about the type of channel\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 8, it is important for the axis label to describe the variable that is being measured.\n\n## Question 9 -- Adding another categorical variable\n\n**Success:** Uses either color or facets to incorporate `species`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Option 1\nggplot(data = fish, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n\n## Option 2\nggplot(data = fish, \n       mapping = aes(x = length_1_mm, y = unittype, color = species)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() \n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** If doesn't use facets or colors\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf they got a growing on #8 for an axis label, they don't get a growing here. \n:::\n\n**Question 10** -- Based on your plot, how different are the lengths of the Cutthroat trout between the different channel types and forest sections?\n\n## Question 10 -- Based on the plot, how different are the lengths between the channel types and forest sections?\n\n**Success:** Must have all of the following\n\n- Comparisons between forest sections (centers, spreads, shapes)\n- Comparisons between channel types\n- State what channel types did not have both types of forest\n\n**Growing:**\n\n- Comparisons are incomplete\n- Does not state what channel types did not have both types of forest\n\n*Feedback:* Careful! For Question 10 you should note if not every forest type \nwas observed for every type of channel.\n\n## Question 11 -- Average length of Cutthroat trout between channel types\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout %>%\n  group_by(unittype) %>%\n  summarize(mean_length = mean(length_1_mm))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf they don't name their summary statistics\n\n*Feedback:* For Question 11, the output of your summary statistics looks a lot\nnicer if you give them names! (like the example that was given)\n\n**Growing:** If process is not correct\n\n## Question 12 -- Find the average length of Cutthroat trout between channel\ntypes and forest section\n\n**Success:** Code should look similar to:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrout %>%\n  group_by(unittype, species) %>%\n  summarize(mean_length = mean(length_1_mm))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Growing:** If process is not correct\n\n## Question 13 -- Differences in averages compared to plot\n\n**Success:**\n\n- States that the averages are all fairly similar\n- \n\n**Growing:** If all they say is that the differences in means are similar to the\nvisualization \n\n*Feedback:* For Question 13, *how* are the differences similar to the\nvisualizations? How does what you saw in the visualizations manifest in these\nmeans? \n\n\n",
