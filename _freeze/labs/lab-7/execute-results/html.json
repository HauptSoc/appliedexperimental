The data is from a study by Johnson et al. at the Plum Island Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research site, studying the relationship between the size (carapace width) of a Fiddler Crab and the geographical location of its habitat. These data can be used to investigate if Bergmann's Rule applies to Fiddler Crabs, or specifically that the size of a crab increases as the distance from the equator increases.\n\n# Our Investigation\n\nThe focus of this lab is on quantifying the relationship between the size of fiddler crabs (response) and the environment in which they live (explanatory).\n\n## Exploring the Data\n\n**1. How many crabs were included in this study?**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Visualizing Relationships\n\n**2. Create a scatterplot modeling the relationship between latitude (explanatory) and the size of a fiddler crab (response).** *Don't forget to add descriptive axis labels!*\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**3. Describe the relationship you see in the scatterplot. Be sure to address the four aspects we discussed in class: form, direction, strength, and unusual points!**\n\n# Testing for a Relationship\n\nFrequently, the first step in a statistical analysis is to conduct a hypothesis test, testing if there is a relationship between the variables. Let's go through the four steps needed to determine whether there is a relationship between these variables.\n\n## Step 1: Summarizing the Relationship\n\nSpecifically, we are interested in the slope statistic, as it captures the relationship between latitude and water temperature.\n\n**4. Fill in the code below to calculate the observed slope for the relationship between the the size of a fiddler crab (response) and latitude (explanatory).** *Note: Nothing will be output when you run this code!*\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobs_slope <- pie_crab %>% \n  specify(response = ____, \n          explanatory = ____) %>% \n  calculate(stat = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Obtain the Permuted Statistics\n\nAfter you have calculated your observed statistic, you need to create a permutation distribution of statistics that might have occurred if the null hypothesis was true.\n\n**5. Fill in the code below to generate 500 permuted statistics for the permutation distribution and save these statistics in an object named `null_dist`.**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnull_dist <- pie_crab %>% \n  specify(response = ____, \n          explanatory = ____) %>% \n  hypothesize(null = ____) %>% \n  generate(reps = ____, \n           type = \"permute\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Visualize the Null Distribution\n\nWe can visualize this null distribution by running the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualise(null_dist) +\n  labs(x = \"Slope Statistic for Relationship Between Crab Size & Latitude\", \n       title = \"Simulated Null Distribution with 500 Reps\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Obtain the p-value\n\nNow that you have calculated the observed statistic and generated a permutation distribution, you can calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the `get_p_value()` function.\n\n**6. Fill in the code below to calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test.**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_p_value(null_dist, \n            obs_stat = ____, \n            direction = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**7. Based on your p-value and an** $\\alpha = 0.1$, **what decision would you reach regarding the null hypothesis?**\n\n**8. Based on your decision, what would you conclude about the relationship between these variables? Be specific!**\n\n<!-- Now switch roles! -->\n\n# Quantifying the Relationship\n\nNow that you've confirmed that there is a relationship between these variables, let's summarize how large this relationship is!\n\nLet's go through the four steps needed to determine whether there is a relationship between these variables.\n\n## Step 1: Approximate Other Statistics that Could Have Happened\n\nFirst, we'll use bootstrapping to obtain statistics that might have happened if we went out and collected a different sample of fiddler crabs.\n\n**9. Fill in the code to generate 500 bootstrap slope statistics (from 500 bootstrap resamples).**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_dist <- pie_crab %>% \n  specify(response = ____, \n          explanatory = ____) %>% \n  generate(reps = ____, \n           type = ____) %>% \n  calculate(stat = ____)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the Bootstrap Distribution\n\nAlright, now that we have the bootstrap slope statistics, let's see how it looks!\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualise(bootstrap_dist) +\n  labs(x = \"Slope Statistic for Relationship Between Crab Size & Latitude\", \n       title = \"Bootstrap Distribution with 500 Resamples\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Obtain Confidence Interval\n\nThe next step to obtain our confidence interval! First we need to determine what percentage of statistics we want to keep in the confidence interval. 90%? 95%? 99%? 80%?\n\nThis seems like a study where we care a bit less about our interval capturing the true value, at least compared to something like a medical study. So, I think this could be a great instance to use a 90% confidence interval.\n\n**10. Use the `get_confidence_interval()` function to find the 90% confidence interval from your bootstrap distribution, using the percentile method!**\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**11. Interpret the confidence interval you obtained in #10. Make sure to include (1) your confidence level, (2) the statistic you are estimating, (3) the population of interest, and (4) your endpoints!**\n\n**12. Based on this interval, does Bergmann's Rule apply to Fiddler Crabs? Specifically, does the size of a crab increases as its distance from the equator increases?**\n",
