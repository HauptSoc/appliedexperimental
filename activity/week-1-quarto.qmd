title: "Introduction to Quarto"
---

Quarto is possibly my favorite thing that happened in 2023! It is an easy-to-use
tool for creating reproducible data analyses. Our weekly lab assignments will be
done in Quarto, so this week each of you is going to complete your own lab 
assignment, so you can get to know Quarto a bit on your own.
