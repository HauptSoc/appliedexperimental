# Today's Data

Today we are working with data on three different species of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

Here is a preview of how the dataset looks:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  slice_sample(n = 10) %>% 
  gt()
```

# One Numerical Variable

Edit the code chunk below to recreate the histogram from the lecture slides:

```{r histogram, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = ____)) + 
  geom_XXXX() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)")
```

How would you change your code to plot a boxplot instead?

What if you wanted to plot a density plot?

# Two Numerical Variables

Edit the code chunk below to recreate the scatterplot from the lecture slides:

```{r scatterplot, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(y = ____, x = ____) +
  geom_XXXX() +
  labs(x = "Bill Depth (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Length (mm)")
```

# Three or More Variables

## Adding Colors to Scatterplots

```{r scatterplot-color-num}

```

What happens when you use a categorical variable to color the points instead?
