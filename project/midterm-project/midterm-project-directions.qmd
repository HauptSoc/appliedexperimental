# Your Task

For this project, you are expected to use a multiple linear regression to investigate the relationship between the variables you outlined in your Midterm Project Proposal. 

# Introduction

-   In **no fewer than six (6)**  sentences describe how the data were collected, the context of the data. Your description should address the following questions:
    * Are these data from a study or a publication?
    * What question do these data address? 
    * Why were the data collected? 
    * How were the data collected?

::: callout-tip
You may need to look up the publication(s) the data are associated with to obtain information on how they were collected.
:::

-   State the question(s) of interest you will address with your statistical analysis. The more specific you define the question of interest here, the easier the rest of the analysis and report will be. The research questions should start with, "What is the relationship between..." and should be as specific as possible. Your **Discussion** section should directly address the question(s) you pose here.

# Methods

This section should lay out the steps, decisions, and logic leading to the statistical model you will use to answer the research question of interest.

-   Describe the response and explanatory variables, how they were measured and
their associated units. For categorical variables, describe the levels of the
categorical variable.

::: callout-tip
You may need to look up the publication(s) the data are associated with to obtain information on how each variable was measured by the researchers. 
:::

-   Produce data visualizations exploring the relationship(s) you are interested
in investigating, contrasting the need for a second explanatory variable.

    -   For a multiple linear regression with one numerical variable and one categorical variable, you should produce **two** visualizations, (1) a scatterplot where each group has a  regression line with its own slope (interaction model), and (2) a scatterplot where every group has parallel regression lines (parallel slopes model).

::: callout-important
# Every visualization should have nicely formatted axis labels!
:::

-   Describe what you see in the visualizations, making direct references to the plots! Specifically, your description or each plot needs to address the following:
    * form
    * direction
    * strength
    * outliers

-   Outline the appropriate statistical model you will use to answer the question(s) of interest that you stated previously. Be specific about ***why*** the method being used are appropriate for the investigation at hand making direct reference to the visualizations.

# Deciding on a Statistical Model

The statistical model you fit in the next section depends on what you see in your visualization. [Click here](../midterm-project-help/one_cat_one_quant_flowchart.jpg) for a flowchart of how you should select the statistical model that is best for your situation.
:::

# Results

In this section you will fit your statistical model and display the results.

-   Fit the statistical model stated at the end of the **Methods** section
-   Obtain the coefficients for the model

::: callout-tip
# Table of Coefficents

Use the `get_regression_table()` function from the **moderndive** package to provide nicely formatted output from your regression model.
:::

# Discussion 

In this section you will write up your findings for each research question of
interest.

-   Write out the estimated regression equation for your statistical model.

    -   For your regression equation, you can either use indicator variables 
    (e.g. $1_{CC}(x)$) for each level of the categorical variable *or* write out a
    different equation for each group.

-   Interpret **in the context of the data** the coefficients from the 
regression equation.

::: {.callout-important}
# Every Coefficient Needs Interpreted!
You need to interpret **both** the intercept and the slope for each group!
:::

-   Connect the findings of your regression back to the research question you 
posed in the **Introduction**. 

-   Propose a possible explanation for why these results were observed. 

::: {.callout-tip}
# External Research

You might need to do a bit of independent research on *why* you obtained 
the results you did. 
:::

# Conclusions

In this section, you will provide a short summary of the key findings of your
analysis, and their connection to the broader scientific community. 

- Based on your visualizations **and** the regression model, what is your
conclusion for the questions of interest?

::: callout-caution
There should be **no** mention of p-values in your conclusion!
:::

<!-- Write a 3-4 sentence statement on what can be inferred from the design of the study and the results of your statistical analysis. Specifically, answer these two questions and comment on their implications: -->

- What are the implications of this research for science in general?

    * Based on the sampling methods used, what larger population can you infer
    the results or your analysis onto?

    * Based on the design of the study, what type of statements can be made
    about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
    Specifically, can cause-and-effect statements be made?
