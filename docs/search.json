    "text": "Welcome!\nIn this week’s coursework we are transitioning into our last topic of the quarter—comparing multiple means. These comparisons have a specific name, ANalysis of VAriance (ANOVA).\nWe are going to use all of the simulation-based methods we learned previously for this new context. An ANOVA relies on a new statistic, the \\(F\\)-statistic, to summarize how different 3 or more means are from each other.\nThe primary focus of an ANOVA is to detect if the means of 3 or more groups are different. Because of this we focus on hypothesis tests for a difference in the group means and do not use confidence intervals. We will generate permutation distributions of \\(F\\)-statistics that we could have observed if the null hypothesis was true (there is no difference in the group means).",

A two-way ANOVA extends the one-way ANOVA to situations with two categorical explanatory variables. This new methods allows researchers to simultaneously study two variables that might explain variability in the responses and explore whether the impacts of one explanatory variable change depending on the level of the other explanatory variable.",

    "text": "1.1 Textbook Reading\nTo be honest, I didn’t have the energy this week to write another chapter on two-way ANOVA. So, instead we will be reading a couple of sections out of another statistics textbook. I’ve uploaded the PDFs of these sections to OneDrive, so you should be able to read them online or download them.\n\nSection 1 – Introduction to Two-Way ANOVA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead through “Step 6” on page 222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.1 – Problematic Undertones\n\n\n\nI want to point out that the context of example 3.1 in this section has some major problematic undertones. The example focuses on “the effects of corporate and endorser credibility” on how likely someone is to buy shoes. For no clear reason, the example only considers “female” college students, which implicitly sends two problematic messages, (1) sex and gender are the same, and (2) women are more easily swayed by advertising.\nIn addition, the example uses Roseanne Barr as one of the celebrity endorsers—an actress who has written deplorable remarks about transgender people.\n\n\n\n\nSection 2 – Two-Way ANOVA Interaction Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead through “Follow-up Confidence Intervals” on page 239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Guide – Due Monday by the start of Class\nDownload the Word Document",

Each week, you will read the required chapter(s), completing a required reading guide to walk you through the central concepts for each week.\nDue Monday by the start of class.\n\n\nConcept quizzes (every week)\nEach week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key concepts from the week’s readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish. The quizzes are marked on completion as complete or incomplete.\nDue Monday by the start of class.\n\n\nTutorials (every week)\nYou can think of the tutorials as an “interactive” textbook, as they interweave statistical ideas alongside examples of how to work with data in R and hands-on exercises writing the R code necessary to complete a given task. Each exercise has hints available if you get stuck!\nThe tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so you are required to complete each week’s tutorial before Wednesday’s lab.\nThe tutorials are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You will submit a screenshot of the completion page at the end of the tutorial to confirm that you completed the tutorial for the week.\nDue Wednesday by the start of class.\n\n\nStatistical critiques (every 4-weeks)\nThese assignments are case studies in which you will evaluate a data visualization or statistical analysis, determining how well-performed and presented the analysis was and making recommendations for improving or using the analysis. Critiques are due roughly 1-week after they are assigned and should take 1-2 hours. You will receive feedback and a mark of Success or Growing (elaborated more on later), and you will be able to revise based on that feedback. There will be two total critiques.\n\n\nLab Assignments (every week)\nLabs will be assigned on Wednesday every week, providing the opportunity to explore the course concepts in the context of real data. Lab assignments will require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials are due before the start of class on Wednesday.\nYou will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with in class. You will access the lab assignment through Posit Cloud, which you will be walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to submit your completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit only the HTML document.\nDue Mondays at 5pm.\n\n\nMidterm & Final Projects (Week 6 & Week 10)\nThere will be two projects throughout the quarter, where you will be asked to synthesize the statistical concepts you have learned in a formal statistical report. Your critiques will help guide you toward how you do / don’t want your report to look. Each project will be done independently, and requires you to submit a project proposal and draft report before the final deadline. You are encouraged to use the feedback received on these assignments to improve your final report. The final reports will be graded as Excellent, Satisfactory, Progressing, or No Credit based on a rubric that will be shared with the initial assignment.",

    "text": "1 Baby Birth Weights\nMedical researchers may be interested in the relationship between a baby’s birth weight and the age of the mother, so as to provide medical interventions for specific age groups if it is found that they are associated with lower birth weights.\nEvery year, the US releases to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in the country. The births14 dataset is a random sample of 1,000 cases from one such dataset released in 2014.\n\n1.1 Observed data\nFigure 1 visualizes the relationship between mage and weight for this sample of 1,000 birth records.\n\nggplot(data = births14, \n       mapping = aes(x = mage, y = weight)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mother's Age\", \n       y = \"Birth Weight of Baby (lbs)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Weight of baby at birth (in lbs) as explained by mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 displays the estimated regression coefficients for modeling the relationship between mage and weight for this sample of 1,000 birth records.\n\nbirths_lm &lt;- lm(weight ~ mage, data = births14)\n\nget_regression_table(births_lm)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope for modeling the relationship between baby’s birth weight and mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd_error\nstatistic\np_value\nlower_ci\nupper_ci\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n6.793\n0.208\n32.651\n0.000\n6.385\n7.201\n\n\nmage\n0.014\n0.007\n1.987\n0.047\n0.000\n0.028\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these coefficients, the estimated regression equation is:\n\\[ \\widehat{\\text{birth weight}} = -6.793 + 0.014 \\times \\text{mother's age}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will let \\(\\beta_1\\) represent the slope of the relationship between baby’s birth weight and mother’s age for every baby born in the US in 2014. We will estimate \\(\\beta_1\\) using the births14 dataset, labeling the estimate \\(b_1\\) (just as we did in Week 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nA parameter is the value of the statistic of interest for the entire population.\nWe typically estimate the parameter using a “point estimate” from a sample of data. The point estimate is also referred to as the statistic.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Variability of the statistic\nThis sample of 1,000 births is only one of possibly tens of thousands of possible samples that could have been taken from the large dataset released in 2014. So, then we might wonder how different our regression equation would be if we had a different sample. There is no reason to believe that \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0.279, but there is also no reason to believe that \\(\\beta_1\\) is particularly far away from \\(b_1 =\\) 0.279.\nJust this week you read about how estimates, such as \\(b_1\\), are prone to sampling variation – the variability from sample to sample. For example, if we took a different sample of 1,000 births, would we obtain a slope of exactly 0.279? No, that seems fairly unlikely. We might obtain a slope of 0.29 or 0.26, or even 0.35!\nWhen we studied the effects of sampling variation, we took many samples, something that was easily done with a shovel and a bowl of red and white balls. In this case, however, how would we obtain another sample? Well, we would need to go to the source of the data—the large public dataset released in 2014—and take another random sample of 1,000 observations. Maybe we don’t have access to that original dataset of 2014 births, how could we study the effects of sampling variation using our single sample? We will do so using a technique known as bootstrap resampling with replacement, which we now illustrate.\n\n\n1.3 Resampling once\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Step 1: Write out mother’s ages and baby’s birth weights on 1,000 slips of paper representing one of the 1,000 births included in the original sample.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Print out 1,000 identically sized slips of paper (or post-it notes) representing the sample of 1,000 babies in our sample. On each piece of paper, write the mother’s age and the birth weight of the baby. Figure 2 displays six of these such papers.\nStep 2: Put the 1,000 slips of paper into a hat as seen in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Step 2: Putting 1,000 slips of paper (post-its) in a hat.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Mix the hat’s contents and draw one slip of paper at random, as seen in Figure 4. Record the mother’s age and baby’s birth weight, as printed on the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Step 3: Drawing one slip of paper at random.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Put the slip of paper back in the hat! In other words, replace it as seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Step 4: Replacing slip of paper.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 a total of 999 more times, resulting in 1,000 recorded mother’s ages and baby birth weights.\nWhat we just performed was a resampling of the original sample of 1,000 birth records. We are not sampling 1,000 birth records from the population of all 2014 US births as we did for our original sample. Instead, we are mimicking this process by resampling 1,000 birth records from our original sample.\nNow ask yourselves, why did we replace our resampled slip of paper back into the hat in Step 4? Because if we left the slip of paper out of the hat each time we performed Step 4, we would end up with the same 1,000 birth records! In other words, replacing the slips of paper induces sampling variation.\nBeing more precise with our terminology, we just performed a resampling with replacement from the original sample of 1,000 birth records. Had we left the slip of paper out of the hat each time we performed Step 4, this would be resampling without replacement.\nLet’s study our sample of 1,000 resampled birth records. First, I’ve made a table of the number of times each observation (birth record) was resampled. Table 2 displays the birth records that were resampled the most often. Based on the table, it appears that record IDs 71 and 534 were resampled six times.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Frequencies of how often a given birth record (ID) was resampled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n534\n170\n561\n19\n142\n305\n309\n495\n573\n726\n727\n835\n838\n840\n864\n919\n924\n929\n953\n\n\n\n\n6\n6\n5\n5\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nWhen sampling with replacement, not every observation is guaranteed to be sampled. So, some observations from the original sample may never appear in the resample, whereas others may appear multiple times.\n\n\nFigure 6 compares the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight from our resample with the relationship in our original sample.\n\nggplot(data = births14, \n       mapping = aes(x = mage, y = weight)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mother's Age\", \n       y = \"Birth Weight (lbs)\")\n\nggplot(data = resample1, \n       mapping = aes(x = mage, y = weight)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mother's Age\", \n       y = \"Birth Weight (lbs)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original Sample of 1,000 Birth Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Resample of 1,000 Birth Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Comparing relationship between mage and weight in the resampled birth records compared to the relationship seen in the original sample of birth records.\n\n\n\n\nObserved in Figure 6 that while the general shape of both relationships are similar, they are not identical.\nRecall, from the previous section that the sample slope (\\(b_1\\)) from the original sample was . What about for our resample? Based on the scatterplot, what would your guess be? Larger than before? Smaller than before?\nLet’s look at the coefficient estimates for the resampled dataset.

Would we obtain the same slope each time? In other words, would our guess at the slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight for all births in the US in 2014 exactly 0.005 every time?"

    "text": "2 Computer simulation and resampling\nIt should be very clear that tactile resampling with a dataset with 1,000 observations would be extremely time consuming, nothing we would want to ask our friends to do. A computer, however, would be happy to do this process for us!\n\n2.1 Virtually resampling once\nFirst, let’s perform the virtual analog of resampling once. Recall that the births14 dataset included in the openintro package contains the 1,000 birth records from the original study. Furthermore, recall in the last chapter that we used the rep_sample_n() function as a virtual shovel to sample balls from our virtual bowl of 2400 balls as follows:\nLet’s modify this code to perform the resampling with replacement from the 1,000 birth records in the original sample:\n\nvirtual_resample &lt;- rep_sample_n(births14, \n                                 size = 1000,\n                                 replace = TRUE, \n                                 reps = 1)\n\nObserve how we explicitly set the replace argument to TRUE in order to tell rep_sample_n() that we would like to sample birth records with replacement. Had we not kept replace = FALSE, we would have done resampling without replacement. Additionally, we changed the sample size, as we need to create a sample with the same size as the original sample which had 1,000 observations.\nLet’s look at only the first 10 out of 1,000 rows of virtual_resample:\n\nvirtual_resample\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 15\n# Groups:   replicate [1]\n   replicate    ID  mage weight  fage mature      weeks premie    visits gained\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1   333    29   7.4     31 younger mom    39 full term     13     50\n 2         1   595    29   0.75    NA younger mom    21 premie         4     NA\n 3         1   338    31   6.94    NA younger mom    39 full term      9     20\n 4         1   531    33   6.94    37 younger mom    39 full term     14     20\n 5         1   289    35   7.98    35 mature mom     38 full term     10     40\n 6         1   461    32   7.15    33 younger mom    39 full term     13     NA\n 7         1   137    26   7.69    36 younger mom    38 full term     NA     25\n 8         1   828    36   4.54    65 mature mom     36 premie        11     10\n 9         1   118    26   8.31    24 younger mom    37 full term     12     25\n10         1    95    38   6.04    37 mature mom     36 premie        10     32\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: lowbirthweight &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, habit &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   marital &lt;chr&gt;, whitemom &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThe replicate variable only takes on the value of 1 corresponding to us only having reps = 1, the ID variable indicates which of the 1,000 birth records was resampled, and mage and weight denote mother’s age and the baby’s birth weight, respectively.\nLet’s now compute the slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight for this resample:\n\nvirtual_resample_lm &lt;- lm(weight ~ mage, data = virtual_resample)\n\nget_regression_table(virtual_resample_lm)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope for modeling the relationship between baby’s birth weight and mother’s age, for the virtual resample of 1,000 birth records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd_error\nstatistic\np_value\nlower_ci\nupper_ci\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n7.156\n0.224\n31.974\n0.000\n6.716\n7.595\n\n\nmage\n0.002\n0.008\n0.210\n0.834\n-0.014\n0.017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw when we did our tactile resampling exercise, Table 4 shows that the estimated slope is different from the slope of our original sample of 0.005.\n\n\n2.2 infer package workflow\nUnfortunately, our process of virtual resampling relies on us fitting a linear regression for each replicate of our virtual_resample dataset. This gets a bit tricky coding wise, as we would need to fit 35 different linear regressions if we had 35 different resamples of our data.\nEnter, infer, an R package for statistical inference. infer makes efficient use of the %&gt;% pipe operator we learned in Week 3 to spell out the sequence of steps necessary to perform statistical inference in a “tidy” and transparent fashion. Furthermore, just as the dplyr package provides functions with verb-like names to perform data wrangling, the infer package provides functions with intuitive verb-like names to perform statistical inference.\nLet’s go back to our original slope. Previously, we computed the value of the sample slope \\(b_1\\) using the lm() function:\n\nbirths_lm &lt;- lm(weight ~ mage, data = births14)\n\nget_regression_table(births_lm)\n\nWe’ll see that we can also do this using infer functions specify() and calculate():\n\nbirths14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nYou might be asking yourself: “Isn’t the infer code longer? Why would I use that code?”. While not immediately apparent, you’ll see that there are three chief benefits to the infer workflow as opposed to the lm() function workflow we had previously.\nFirst, the infer verb names better align with the overall resampling framework you need to understand to construct confidence intervals and to conduct hypothesis tests. We’ll see flowchart diagrams of this framework in the upcoming Figure 12.\nSecond, you can jump back and forth seamlessly between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing with minimal changes to your code. This will become apparent next week, when we also use infer to conduct hypothesis tests for the slope statistic.\nThird, the infer workflow is much simpler for conducting inference when you have more than one variable, meaning we can extend what we’ve learned for simple linear regression to multiple linear regression models.\nLet’s now illustrate the sequence of verbs necessary to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\b_1\\), the slope of the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight for all US births in 2014.\n\n1. specify() variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: “Diagram of specify()ing variables.”\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 7, the specify() function is used to choose which variables in a data frame will be the focus of our statistical inference. We do this by specifying the response argument. For example, in our births14 data frame, the response variable of interest is weight and the explanatory variable is mage:\n\nbirths14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage)\n\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   weight  mage\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1   6.96    34\n 2   8.86    31\n 3   7.51    36\n 4   6.19    16\n 5   6.75    31\n 6   6.69    26\n 7   6.13    36\n 8   6.74    24\n 9   8.94    32\n10   9.12    26\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nNotice how the dataset got smaller, now there are only two columns where before there were 14. You should also notice the messages above the dataset (Response: weight (numeric) and Explanatory: mage). These are meta-data about the grouping structure of the dataset, declaring which variable has been assigned to the explanatory / response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is similar to how the group_by() verb from dplyr doesn’t change the data, but only adds “grouping” meta-data, as we saw in Week 3.\n\n\n\n\n2. generate() replicates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: “Diagram of generate() replicates.”\n\n\n\nAfter we specify() the variables of interest, we pipe the results into the generate() function to generate replicates. Figure 8 shows how this is combined with specify() to start the pipeline. In other words, repeat the resampling process a large number of times, similar to how we collected 35 different samples of balls from the bowl.\nThe generate() function’s first argument is reps, which sets the number of replicates we would like to generate. Suppose we were interested in obtaining 50 different resamples (each of 1,000 birth records). Then, we would we set reps = 50, telling infer that we are interested in obtaining 50 different resamples, each with 1,000 observations.\nThe second argument type determines the type of computer simulation we’d like to perform. We set this to type = \"bootstrap\" indicating that we want to perform bootstrap resampling, meaning the resampling should be done with replacement. You’ll see different options for type when we learn about hypothesis testing next week.\n\nbirths14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 50, \n           type = \"bootstrap\")\n\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 50,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [50]\n   replicate weight  mage\n       &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1  10.6     31\n 2         1   4.31    31\n 3         1   4.94    33\n 4         1   5.65    36\n 5         1   8       23\n 6         1   7.63    37\n 7         1   8       19\n 8         1   3.22    30\n 9         1   8.56    32\n10         1   4.32    21\n# ℹ 49,990 more rows\n\n\nObserve that the resulting data frame has 50,000 rows. This is because we performed resampling of 1000 birth records with replacement 50 times and 1000 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 50,000.\nThe variable replicate indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value 1 1000 times, the value 2 1000 times, all the way through to the value 50 1000 times.\nComparing with original workflow: Note that the steps of the infer workflow so far produce the same results as the original workflow using the rep_sample_n() function we saw earlier. In other words, the following two code chunks produce similar results:\n\n\ninfer workflow\n\nbirths14 %&gt;%\n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 50, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") \n\n\n\n\nOriginal workflow\n\nrep_sample_n(births14, \n             size = 1000, \n             replace = TRUE,\n             reps = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n3. calculate() summary statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Diagram of calculate()d summary statistics.\n\n\n\nAfter we generate() many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize each of the 50 resamples of size 1000 to a single sample statistic value. As seen in Figure 9, the calculate() function does this.\nIn our case, we want to calculate the slope between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight for each bootstrap resample of size 1000. To do so, we set the stat argument to \"slope\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also set the stat argument to a variety of other common summary statistics, like \"median\", \"sum\", \"sd\" (standard deviation), and \"prop\" (proportion). To see a list of all possible summary statistics you can use, type ?calculate and read the help file.\n\n\nLet’s save the result in a data frame called bootstrap_distribution and explore its contents:\n\nbootstrap_distribution &lt;- births14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 50) %&gt;% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nbootstrap_distribution\n\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 50 × 2\n   replicate    stat\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1 0.0328 \n 2         2 0.0181 \n 3         3 0.0123 \n 4         4 0.0106 \n 5         5 0.0183 \n 6         6 0.0190 \n 7         7 0.0145 \n 8         8 0.00824\n 9         9 0.0155 \n10        10 0.0160 \n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nObserve that the resulting data frame has 50 rows and two columns. The replicate column corresponds to the 50 replicates and the stat column corresponds to the estimated slope for each resample.\n\n\n4. visualize() the results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Diagram of closing the entire process by visualize()ing the results.\n\n\n\nThe visualize()verb provides a quick way to visualize the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the numerical stat variable’s values. The pipeline of the main infer verbs used for exploring bootstrap distribution results is shown in Figure 11.\n\nvisualize(bootstrap_distribution)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Bootstrap distribution of slope statistics from 50 bootstrap resamples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe visualize() function can take many other arguments which we’ll see momentarily to customize the plot further. It also works with helper functions to do the shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values.\n\n\nComparing with original workflow: In fact, visualize() is a wrapper function for the ggplot() function that uses a geom_histogram() layer. That’s a lot of fancy language which means that the visualize() function does the same thing as we did previously with ggplot(), just with fewer steps.\n\n\ninfer workflow\n\nvisualize(bootstrap_distribution)\n\n\n\n\nOriginal workflow\n\nggplot(data = bootstrap_distribution,\n       mapping = aes(x = stat)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nCareful! It might sound tempting to ditch the ggplot() code altogether now that you know of a simpler approach. The visualize() function only works for a specific case – a data frame containing a distribution of calculate()d statistics.\n\n\nLet’s recap the steps of the infer workflow for constructing a bootstrap distribution and then visualizing it in Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: infer package workflow for resampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Virtually resampling 1,000 times\nTo change from resampling 50 times to resampling 1,000 times, only one line of code needs to change—the number of reps. In the code process below, we’ve chained together the entire infer pipeline, connecting the specify, generate, calculate, and visualize steps.\n\nbootstrap_1000 &lt;- births14 |&gt; \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) |&gt; \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\") \n\nvisualize(bootstrap_1000) + \n  labs(x = \"Bootstrap Slope Statistic\", \n       y = \"Bootstrap Distribution of 1,000 Resamples\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Bootstrap distribution with 1,000 replicates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging axis labels\n\n\n\nNotice you can still use the labs() function to change your axis labels. Notice that you still need to connect the axis labels with the plot using a + sign.\n\n\nWhat do you notice about this distribution? What distribution does it resemble? Why is that the case?\n\n\n2.4 Connection to sampling distributions\nThe histogram of sample slopes in Figure 13 is called the bootstrap distribution. The bootstrap distribution is an approximation to the sampling distribution of sample slopes.\nIf you recall back to the last chapter, a sampling distribution was a distribution of statistics from repeatedly sampling from the population. However, a bootstrap distribution is a distribution of statistics from repeatedly resampling from the sample. This may seem rather strange, how can a distribution based entirely on the sample approximate a distribution based on the population? That’s a great question!\nThe bootstrapping process hinges on the belief that the sample is representative of the population. Meaning, there are not systematic differences between the sample and the population. For example, if there were no young mothers in the sample of 1,000 birth records in the births14 dataset. If we have a random sample, however, then on average our sample should look very similar to our population. Meaning, the individuals in the sample can “stand in” for individuals in the population with similar characteristics. So, we can think of repeatedly resampling from our sample as a similar process as sampling from the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo guaranteed representation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of randomly sampling does not guarantee that smaller groups of observations will always appear in the sample. Rather, by randomly sampling from the population, on average the representation of individuals in the sample should reflect the proportion of individuals in the population.\nTo me, this feels rather uncomfortable as a random sample assumes that you can generalize from the sample onto the population from which it was drawn. This means you are generalizing the observations of a few individuals onto the entire population of similar individuals. For example, if you were to collect a random sample of Cal Poly students, it is likely your sample would include very few Black students (as Cal Poly is a predominantly white institution). But, if your sample was random, statistically you could infer from your small sample of Black students onto the entire population of Black students at Cal Poly. That seems kind of iffy to me."

    "section": "3 Understanding confidence intervals",
    "text": "3 Understanding confidence intervals\nLet’s start this section with an analogy involving fishing. Say you are trying to catch a fish. On the one hand, you could use a spear, while on the other you could use a net. Using the net will probably allow you to catch more fish!\nIn the births14 investigation, we are trying to estimate the population slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight (\\(\\beta_1\\)) for all babies born in the US in 2014. Think of the value of \\(\\beta_1\\) as a fish.\nOn the one hand, we could use the appropriate point estimate/sample statistic to estimate \\(\\beta_1\\), which we saw in Table 1 is the sample slope \\(b_1\\). Based on our sample of 1000 birth records, the sample slope was 0.014. Think of using this value as “fishing with a spear.”\nWhat would “fishing with a net” correspond to? Look at the bootstrap distribution in Figure 13 once more. Between which values would you say that “most” sample slopes lie? While this question is somewhat subjective, saying that most sample slopes lie between 0 and 0.03 would not be unreasonable. Think of this interval as the “net.”\nWhat we’ve just illustrated is the concept of a confidence interval, which I’ll abbreviate with “CI” throughout this chapter. As opposed to a point estimate / sample statistic that estimates the value of an unknown population parameter with a single value, a confidence interval gives what can be interpreted as a range of plausible values. Going back to our analogy, point estimates / sample statistics can be thought of as spears, whereas confidence intervals can be thought of as nets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Analogy of difference between point estimates and confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nOur proposed interval of 0 to 0.03 was constructed by eye and was thus somewhat subjective. We now introduce two methods for constructing such intervals in a more exact fashion: the percentile method and the standard error method.\nBoth methods for confidence interval construction share some commonalities. First, they are both constructed from a bootstrap distribution, as you constructed in the previous section and visualized in Figure 13.\nSecond, they both require you to specify the confidence level. Commonly used confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%. All other things being equal, higher confidence levels correspond to wider confidence intervals, and lower confidence levels correspond to narrower confidence intervals.\n\n3.1 Percentile method\nOne method to construct a 95% confidence interval is to use the middle 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution. We can do this by computing the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, which are 0.0002 and 0.0281, respectively. This is known as the percentile method for constructing confidence intervals.\nFor now, let’s focus only on the concepts behind a percentile method constructed confidence interval; we’ll show you the code that computes these values in the next section.\nLet’s mark these percentiles on the bootstrap distribution with vertical lines in Figure 15. About 95% of the slope variable values in bootstrap_1000 fall between 0.0002 and 0.0281, with 2.5% to the left of the leftmost line and 2.5% to the right of the rightmost line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Percentile method 95% confidence interval. Interval endpoints marked by vertical lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Standard error method\nRecall in the last chapter we saw that if a numerical variable follows a normal distribution, or, in other words, the histogram of this variable is bell-shaped, then roughly 95% of values fall between \\(\\pm\\) 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Given that our bootstrap distribution based on 1000 resamples with replacement in Figure 13 is normally shaped, let’s use this fact about normal distributions to construct a confidence interval in a different way.\nFirst, recall the bootstrap distribution has a mean equal to 0.014. This value almost coincides exactly with the value of the sample slope \\(b_1\\) of our original 1000 birth records 0.014. Second, let’s compute the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution using the bootstrap slope statistics stored in the stat column of the bootstrap_1000 data frame:\n\nbootstrap_1000 %&gt;% \n  summarize(SE = sd(stat))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n       SE\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.00722\n\n\nWhat is this value? Recall that the bootstrap distribution is an approximation to the sampling distribution. Thus, the variability of the sampling distribution may be approximated by the variability of the resampling distribution. Recall also that the standard deviation of a sampling distribution has a special name: the standard error. Putting these two facts together, we can say that 0.00722 is an approximation of the standard error of \\(b_1\\).\nTraditional theory-based methodologies for inference also have formulas for standard errors, assuming some conditions are not violated. In this method, we are not using a formula to get our standard error, but using the standard error of the bootstrap distribution. Thus, using our 95% rule of thumb about normal distributions, we can use the following formula to determine the lower and upper endpoints of a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\):\n\\[\nb_1 \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = (b_1 - 1.96 \\times SE, b_1 + 1.96 \\times SE)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (0.014 - 1.96 \\times 0.007, 0.014 + 1.96 \\times 0.007)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (0.00028, 0.02772)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo use the bootstrap standard error in this formula the bootstrap distribution must be bell shaped and symmetric. This is often the case with bootstrap distributions, especially those in which the original distribution of the sample is not highly skewed, however it is not always the case. Next week, we’ll go deeper into the explorations of model conditions.\n\n\nLet’s now add the SE method confidence interval with dashed lines in Figure 16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Comparing two 95% confidence interval methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that both methods produce nearly identical 95% confidence intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\) with the percentile method yielding \\((0.0002, 0.0281)\\) while the standard error method produces \\((0.0001, 0.0284)\\).\nNow that we’ve introduced the concept of confidence intervals and laid out the intuition behind two methods for constructing them, let’s explore the code that allows us to construct them."

    "text": "4 Constructing confidence intervals\nNow that we’ve covered two methods for obtaining confidence intervals, let’s now check out the infer package code that explicitly constructs these. There are also some additional neat functions to visualize the resulting confidence intervals built-in to the infer package!\n\nPercentile method with infer\nRecall the percentile method for constructing 95% confidence intervals we introduced in Section 3.1. This method sets the lower endpoint of the confidence interval at the 2.5th percentile of the bootstrap distribution and similarly sets the upper endpoint at the 97.5th percentile. The resulting interval captures the middle 95% of the values of the sample mean in the bootstrap distribution.\nWe can compute the 95% confidence interval using the get_confidence_interval() function function from the infer package. This function takes three arguments (inputs):\n\na data frame containing calculate()d statistics (e.g., slope statistics)\na confidence level (e.g., 0.95 or 0.99)\nthe type of interval to be made – \"percentile\" or \"se\"\n\n\npercentile_ci &lt;- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_distribution, \n                                         level = 0.95, \n                                         type = \"percentile\")\npercentile_ci\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower_ci upper_ci\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.00185   0.0285\n\n\nAlternatively, we can visualize this interval by adding a shade_confidence_interval() layer to the visualize() step. This step requires the endpoints of the interval to be specified, so the previous step must come before the following step.\n\nvisualize(bootstrap_1000) + \n  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Percentile method 95% confidence interval shaded corresponding to potential values.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve in Figure 17 that 95% of the sample slopes stored in the stat variable in bootstrap_1000 fall between the two endpoints marked with the darker lines, with 2.5% of the sample means to the left of the shaded area and 2.5% of the sample means to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe default colors for shade_confidence_interval() are color = \"mediumaquamarine\" and fill = \"turquoise\".

From properties of the Normal Distribution, we know that for any distribution that is bell shaped and symmetric, roughly 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Recall that in the case of the sampling distribution, the standard deviation has a special name: the standard error. Moreover, remember that the bootstrap distribution provides us with a robust estimate of the standard error of the sampling distribution.\nSo in our case, 95% of values of the bootstrap distribution will lie within \\(\\pm 1.96\\) standard errors of \\(b_1\\). Thus, a 95% confidence interval is\n\\[\nb_a \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = (b_1 - 1.96 \\times SE, b_1 + 1.96 \\times SE)\n\\]\nComputation of the 95% confidence interval can once again be done by inputting the the bootstrap_1000 data frame we created into the get_confidence_interval() function, using roughly the same code as before. There are two components, however, that must change:\n\nwe need to set the type argument to be \"se\"\nwe need to specify where the confidence interval should be centered – the point_estimate\n\nTo calculate the point estimate, we need one additional step before calculating our confidence interval. Rather than using the output from the lm() function like we did in Table 1, let’s obtain our observed slope statistic using the infer pipeline! This process should look familiar, in fact the only part that has changed is we no longer have a generate() step. We are not generating any resamples, so that step is no longer needed. All we need to do is specify() our variables and calculate() the \"slope\" statistic.\n\nobs_slope &lt;- births14 |&gt; \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nstandard_error_ci &lt;- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000, \n                                             type = \"se\", \n                                             point_estimate = obs_slope, \n                                             level = 0.95)\nstandard_error_ci\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   lower_ci upper_ci\n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0000947   0.0284\n\n\nIf we would like to visualize this interval, we can once again add a shade_confidence_interval() layer to our plot.

    "text": "5 Interpreting confidence intervals\nNow that we’ve shown you how to construct confidence intervals using a sample drawn from a population, let’s now focus on how to interpret their effectiveness. The effectiveness of a confidence interval is judged by whether or not it contains the true value of the population parameter. Going back to our fishing analogy in Section 3, this is like asking, “Did our net capture the fish?”.\nSo, for example, does our percentile-based confidence interval of (-0.0018, 0.0285) “capture” the slope of the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight (\\(\\beta_1\\)) for all babies born in the US in 2014? Alas, we’ll never know, because we don’t know what the true value of \\(\\beta_1\\) is. After all, we’re sampling to estimate it!\nIn order to interpret a confidence interval’s effectiveness, we need to know what the value of the population parameter is. That way we can say whether or not a confidence interval “captured” this value. In the case of births14 dataset, we have the ability to go find the original dataset, housing the birth records of every baby born in the US in 2014. I did so, and found that the slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight (\\(\\beta_1\\)) for all babies born in the US in 2014 was \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\).\n\n5.1 Did our interval(s) capture \\(\\beta_1\\)?\nNow that we know the value of \\(\\beta_1\\), we can see if the intervals we constructed previously do in fact contain this parameter. The percentile interval of (-0.0018, 0.0285) contains \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\) and the SE interval of 0.0001, 0.0284) also contains \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\). Will our 95% confidence intervals always contain \\(\\beta_1\\)? Let’s see!\n\n\n5.2 Constructing more intervals\nLet’s construct 50 more confidence intervals for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the infer workflow we learned before. We can then compare how many of these confidence intervals “captured” the true value of \\(\\beta_1\\), which we know to be 0.0007. That is to say, “Did the net capture the fish?”.\nIn the code below, we create a second bootstrap distribution, also with 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Then, using this second bootstrap distribution, we use the percentile method to calculate a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice of method\n\n\n\nI’ve chosen to use the percentile method as we saw that the intervals had similar results and the percentile method has fewer steps. So, I’m choosing to be efficient! However, since we saw the bootstrap distribution was bell shaped and symmetric, either method would work.\n\n\n\nbootstrap_1000_v2 &lt;- births14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %&gt;% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n  \npercentile_ci_2 &lt;- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000_v2, \n                                         level = 0.95)\npercentile_ci_2\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n    lower_ci upper_ci\n       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0000326   0.0285\n\n\nNotice this interval, also contains \\(\\beta_1\\). Let’s do this again…\n\nbootstrap_1000_v3 &lt;- births14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, \n          explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 1000, \n           type = \"bootstrap\") %&gt;% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n  \npercentile_ci_3 &lt;- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_1000_v3, \n                                         level = 0.95)\npercentile_ci_3\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   lower_ci upper_ci\n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.000133   0.0285\n\n\nAgain, our interval contains \\(\\beta_1\\). Let’s scale this up and look at 50 different intervals constructed using this method. Figure 19 visualizes these 50 intervals, where:\n\nthe true value of \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\) is marked with a red, vertical line\neach of the intervals is marked with a horizontal line\n\nIf the interval contained \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\), the line is colored grey. If the interval did not contain \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\), the line is colored black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: 50 percentile-based 95% confidence intervals for the true slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight, for all babies born in the US in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 50 95% confidence intervals, 46 of them captured the true value of \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\), whereas 4 of them didn’t. In other words, 46 of our nets caught the fish, and 4 of our nets didn’t.\nThis is where the “95% confidence level” comes into play: for every 50 95% confidence intervals constructed, we expect that about 95% of them will capture \\(\\beta_1\\) and 5% of them won’t. That’s a bit tricky for 50, as 95% of 50 is 47.5. Technically, we can only have either 47 or 48 intervals contain \\(\\beta_1\\), but this should reinforce that the process is not exact. We will not always get 95% of the intervals containing \\(\\beta_1\\), but on average we expect that 95% of them should.\n\n\n5.3 Connection to the empiracle rule\nYou might wonder, why do only 5% of the 95% confidence intervals miss the parameter they are estimating. This reasoning goes back to what you read on the empiracle rule for bell-shaped and symmetric curves. Namely, the rule of thumb that 95% of values will lie within approximately 2 standard deviations of the center of the distribution. The center of a sampling distribution is the value of the parameter. For our example, this value is \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\), the value of the slope for the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight for all babies born in the US in 2014.\nFigure 20 displays the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\), centered at \\(\\beta_1 = 0.0007\\). Because our sampling distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, we know that 95% of the slope statistics should fall within 2 standard errors of the center, as noted by the two dashed lines. That means, only 5% of the slope statistics should fall outside this interval. Our sample slope statistic (\\(b_1\\)) is always the center of our confidence interval. So, if our sample slope statistic is greater than 2 standard deviations from the center of the sampling distribution, its confidence interval will not contain \\(\\beta_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Rules of thumb about areas under normal curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Precise and shorthand interpretation\nLet’s return our attention to 95% confidence intervals. The precise and mathematically correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is a little long-winded:\n\nPrecise interpretation: If we repeated our sampling procedure a large number of times, we expect about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals to capture the value of the population parameter.\n\nThis is what we observed in Figure 19. Our confidence interval construction procedure is 95% reliable. That is to say, we can expect our confidence intervals to include the true population parameter about 95% of the time.\nA common but incorrect interpretation is: “There is a 95% probability that the confidence interval contains \\(\\beta_1\\).” Looking at Figure 19, each of the confidence intervals either does or doesn’t contain \\(\\beta_1\\). In other words, the probability is either 100% or 0%.\nSo if the 95% confidence level only relates to the reliability of the confidence interval construction procedure and not to a given confidence interval itself, what insight can be derived from a given confidence interval? Loosely speaking, we can think of these intervals as our “best guess” of a plausible range of values for the slope of the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight \\(\\beta_1\\) of all babies born in the US in 2014. It is typical to use the following shorthand summary of the precise interpretation:\n\nWe are 95% “confident” that a 95% confidence interval captures the value of the population parameter. We use quotation marks around “confident” to emphasize that while 95% relates to the reliability of our confidence interval construction procedure, ultimately a constructed confidence interval is our best guess of an interval that contains the population parameter. In other words, it’s our best net.\n\nSo returning to the first confidence interval we calculated, we would interpret this interval as “We are 95% ‘confident’ that the slope of the relationship between mother’s age and baby’s birth weight \\(\\beta_1\\) of all babies born in the US in 2014 is between -0.0018 and 0.0285.\n\n\n5.5 Width of confidence intervals\nNow that we know how to interpret confidence intervals, let’s go over some factors that determine their width.\n\nImpact of confidence level\nOne factor that determines confidence interval widths is the pre-specified confidence level. For example, we used 95% confidence intervals for this reading, but we could have equally chosen 85% intervals. A 95% confidence interval created using the percentile method contains 95% of the values in the bootstrap distribution. An 85% confidence interval would only contain 85% of these values, so it would be a narrower confidence interval. The quantification of the confidence level should match what many expect of the word “confident.” In order to be more confident in our best guess of a range of values, we need to widen the range of values.\nTo elaborate on this, imagine we want to guess the forecasted high temperature in Seoul, South Korea on August 15th. Given Seoul’s temperate climate with four distinct seasons, we could say somewhat confidently that the high temperature would be between 50°F - 95°F (10°C - 35°C). However, if we wanted a temperature range we were absolutely confident about, we would need to widen it.\nWe need this wider range to allow for the possibility of anomalous weather, like a freak cold spell or an extreme heat wave. So a range of temperatures we could be near certain about would be between 32°F - 110°F (0°C - 43°C). On the other hand, if we could tolerate being a little less confident, we could narrow this range to between 70°F - 85°F (21°C - 30°C).\nSo in order to have a higher confidence level, our confidence intervals must be wider. Ideally, we would have both a high confidence level and narrow confidence intervals. However, we cannot have it both ways. If we want to be more confident, we need to allow for wider intervals. Conversely, if we would like a narrow interval, we must tolerate a lower confidence level.\n\nThe moral of the story is: Higher confidence levels tend to produce wider confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nImpact of sample size\nPulling from what we learned about the Central Limit Theorem at the end of the last reading, we know that variability decreases when sample size increases. We quantified the sampling variation of these sampling distributions using their standard deviation, which has that special name: the standard error. So as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases.\nConnecting to what you learned in this reading, if we have a large sample size, the spread of the bootstrap distribution will be smaller, which in turn leads to smaller estimated standard errors, and narrower confidence intervals. In Section 3.2 you saw directly how the standard error is used when calculating a confidence interval."

It has a certain number of red and a certain number of white balls all of equal size. Furthermore, it appears the bowl has been mixed beforehand, as there does not seem to be any coherent pattern to the spatial distribution of the red and white balls.\nLet’s now ask ourselves, what proportion of this bowl’s balls are red?\nOne way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each ball individually, count the number of red balls and the number of white balls, and divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls. However, this would be a long and tedious process.\n\n\n1.2 Using the shovel once\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Inserting a shovel into the bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Removing 50 balls from the bowl.\n\n\n\nInstead of performing an exhaustive count, let’s insert a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure 2. Using the shovel, let’s remove \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) balls, as seen in Figure 3.\nObserve that 17 of the balls are red and thus 0.34 = 34% of the shovel’s balls are red. We can view the proportion of balls that are red in this shovel as a guess of the proportion of balls that are red in the entire bowl. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count of all the balls in the bowl, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to make.\nHowever, say, we started this activity over from the beginning. In other words, we replace the 50 balls back into the bowl and start over. Would we remove exactly 17 red balls again? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red be exactly 34% again? Maybe?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Repeating sampling activity 33 times.\n\n\n\nWhat if we repeated this activity several times following the process, as shown in Figure 4? Would we obtain exactly 17 red balls each time? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red be exactly 34% every time? Surely not. Let’s repeat this exercise several times with the help of 33 groups of friends to understand how the value differs with repetition.\n\n\n1.3 Using the shovel 33 times\nEach of our 33 groups of friends will do the following:\n\nUse the shovel to remove 50 balls each.\nCount the number of red balls and thus compute the proportion of the 50 balls that are red.\nReturn the balls into the bowl.\nMix the contents of the bowl a little to not let a previous group’s results influence the next group’s.\n\nEach of our 33 groups of friends make note of their proportion of red balls from their sample collected. Each group then marks their proportion of their 50 balls that were red in the appropriate bin in a hand-drawn histogram as seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Constructing a histogram of proportions.\n\n\n\nRecall from Week 2 that histograms allow us to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. In particular, where the center of the values falls and how the values vary. A partially completed histogram of the first 10 out of 33 groups of friends’ results can be seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Hand-drawn histogram of first 10 out of 33 proportions.\n\n\n\nObserve the following in the histogram in Figure 6:\n\nAt the low end, one group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion red between 0.20 and 0.25.\nAt the high end, another group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.45 and 0.5 red.\nHowever, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 and 0.35 red, right in the middle of the distribution.\nThe shape of this distribution is somewhat bell-shaped.\n\nLet’s construct this same hand-drawn histogram in R using your data visualization skills that you honed in Week 2! We saved our 33 groups of friends’ results in the tactile_prop_red data frame included in the moderndive package. Run the following to display the first 10 of 33 rows:\n\ntactile_prop_red\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 4\n   group            replicate red_balls prop_red\n   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Ilyas, Yohan             1        21     0.42\n 2 Morgan, Terrance         2        17     0.34\n 3 Martin, Thomas           3        21     0.42\n 4 Clark, Frank             4        21     0.42\n 5 Riddhi, Karina           5        18     0.36\n 6 Andrew, Tyler            6        19     0.38\n 7 Julia                    7        19     0.38\n 8 Rachel, Lauren           8        11     0.22\n 9 Daniel, Caroline         9        15     0.3 \n10 Josh, Maeve             10        17     0.34\n# ℹ 23 more rows\n\n\nObserve for each group that we have their names, the number of red_balls they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 balls that were red named prop_red. We also have a replicate variable enumerating each of the 33 groups. We chose this name because each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated (in other words repeated) activity: using the shovel to remove 50 balls and computing the proportion of those balls that are red.\nLet’s visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using geom_histogram() with binwidth = 0.05 in Figure 7. This is a computerized and complete version of the partially completed hand-drawn histogram you saw in Figure 6. Note that setting boundary = 0.4 indicates that we want a binning scheme such that one of the bins’ boundary is at 0.4. This helps us to more closely align this histogram with the hand-drawn histogram in Figure 6.\n\nggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 50 balls that were red\", \n       title = \"Distribution of 33 proportions red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 What did we just do?\nWhat we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of sampling. We would like to know the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. Because the bowl has a large number of balls, performing an exhaustive count of the red and white balls would be time-consuming. We thus extracted a sample of 50 balls using the shovel to make an estimate. Using this sample of 50 balls, we estimated the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red to be 34%.\nMoreover, because we mixed the balls before each use of the shovel, the samples were randomly drawn. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. Because the samples were different from each other, we obtained the different proportions red observed in Figure 7. This is known as the concept of sampling variation.\nThe purpose of this sampling activity was to develop an understanding of two key concepts relating to sampling:\n\nUnderstanding the effect of sampling variation.\nUnderstanding the effect of sample size on sampling variation.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll mimic the hands-on sampling activity we just performed on a computer. This will allow us not only to repeat the sampling exercise much more than 33 times, but it will also allow us to use shovels with different numbers of slots than just 50.\nAfterwards, we’ll present you with definitions, terminology, and notation related to sampling. As in many disciplines, such necessary background knowledge may seem inaccessible and even confusing at first. However, as with many difficult topics, if you truly understand the underlying concepts and practice, practice, practice, you’ll be able to master them.\nTo close this chapter, we’ll generalize the “sampling from a bowl” exercise to other sampling scenarios and present a theoretical result known as the Central Limit Theorem."

    "text": "2 Virtual sampling\nIn the previous section, we performed a tactile sampling activity by hand. In other words, we used a physical bowl of balls and a physical shovel. We performed this sampling activity by hand first so that we could develop a firm understanding of the root ideas behind sampling. In this section, we’ll mimic this tactile sampling activity with a virtual sampling activity using a computer. In other words, we’ll use a virtual analog to the bowl of balls and a virtual analog to the shovel.\n\n2.1 Using the virtual shovel once\nLet’s start by performing the virtual analog of the tactile sampling exercise we performed before. We first need a virtual analog of the bowl seen in Figure Figure 1. To this end, we included a data frame named bowl in the moderndive package. The rows of bowl correspond exactly with the contents of the actual bowl.\n\nbowl\n\n# A tibble: 2,400 × 2\n   ball_ID color\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1       1 white\n 2       2 white\n 3       3 white\n 4       4 red  \n 5       5 white\n 6       6 white\n 7       7 red  \n 8       8 white\n 9       9 red  \n10      10 white\n# ℹ 2,390 more rows\n\n\nObserve that bowl has 2400 rows, telling us that the bowl contains 2400 equally sized balls. The first variable ball_ID is used as an identification variable – none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable color indicates whether a particular virtual ball is red or white. You can view the contents of the bowl in RStudio’s data viewer, scrolling through the contents to convince yourself that bowl is indeed a virtual analog of the actual bowl in Figure 1.\nNow that we have a virtual analog of our bowl, we next need a virtual analog to the shovel seen in Figure 3 to generate virtual samples of 50 balls. We’re going to use the rep_sample_n() function included in the infer package. This function allows us to take repeated, or replicated, samples of size n from a given dataset.\nLooking at the code below you should notice:\n\nThe dataset (bowl) is the first argument\nsize corresponds to the size of each sample\nreps corresponds to the number of samples\nreplace corresponds to whether each sampled observation should be replaced after it is drawn\n\n\nvirtual_shovel &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl,\n                               size = 50, \n                               replace = FALSE,\n                               reps = 1)\nvirtual_shovel\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1]\n   replicate ball_ID color\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1         1     537 red  \n 2         1     922 white\n 3         1     721 white\n 4         1    1503 white\n 5         1     829 red  \n 6         1     967 white\n 7         1    1906 red  \n 8         1     816 red  \n 9         1    1248 white\n10         1    1474 red  \n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nObserve that virtual_shovel has 50 rows corresponding to our virtual sample of size 50. The ball_ID variable identifies which of the 2400 balls from bowl are included in our sample of 50 balls while color denotes its color. However, what does the replicate variable indicate? In virtual_shovel’s case, replicate is equal to 1 for all 50 rows. This is telling us that these 50 rows correspond to the first repeated/replicated use of the shovel, in our case our first sample. We’ll see shortly that when we “virtually” take 33 samples, replicate will take values between 1 and 33.\nLet’s compute the proportion of balls in our virtual sample that are red using the dplyr data wrangling verbs you learned in Week 3. First, for each of our 50 sampled balls, let’s identify if it is red or not using a test for equality with ==. Let’s create a new Boolean variable is_red using the mutate() function:\n\nmutate(.data = virtual_shovel, \n       is_red = (color == \"red\")\n       )\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 4\n# Groups:   replicate [1]\n   replicate ball_ID color is_red\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; \n 1         1     537 red   TRUE  \n 2         1     922 white FALSE \n 3         1     721 white FALSE \n 4         1    1503 white FALSE \n 5         1     829 red   TRUE  \n 6         1     967 white FALSE \n 7         1    1906 red   TRUE  \n 8         1     816 red   TRUE  \n 9         1    1248 white FALSE \n10         1    1474 red   TRUE  \n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nObserve that for every row where color == \"red\", the Boolean (logical) value TRUE is returned and for every row where color is not equal to \"red\", the Boolean FALSE is returned.\nSecond, let’s compute the number of balls out of 50 that are red using the summarize() function. Recall from Week 3 that summarize() takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics, like the mean() or median(). In this case, we use the sum() function:\n\nmutate(.data = virtual_shovel, \n       is_red = (color == \"red\")\n       ) %&gt;% \nsummarize(num_red = sum(is_red)\n          )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  replicate num_red\n      &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1         1      24\n\n\nWhy does this work? Because R treats TRUE like the number 1 and FALSE like the number 0. So summing the number of TRUEs and FALSEs is equivalent to summing 1’s and 0’s. In the end, this operation counts the number of balls where color is red. In our case, 24 of the 50 balls were red. However, you might have gotten a different number red because of the randomness of the virtual sampling.\nThird and lastly, let’s compute the proportion of the 50 sampled balls that are red by dividing num_red by 50:\n\nmutate(.data = virtual_shovel, \n       is_red = (color == \"red\")\n       ) %&gt;% \nsummarize(num_red = sum(is_red) / 50\n          )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  replicate num_red\n      &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1    0.48\n\n\nGreat! 48% of virtual_shovel’s 50 balls were red! So based on this particular sample of 50 balls, our guess at the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red is 48%. But remember from our earlier tactile sampling activity that if we repeat this sampling, we will not necessarily obtain the same value of 48% again. There will likely be some variation. In fact, our 33 groups of friends computed 33 such proportions whose distribution we visualized in Figure 6. We saw that these estimates varied. Let’s now perform the virtual analog of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel!\n\n\n2.2 Using the virtual shovel 33 times\nRecall that in our tactile sampling exercise, we had 33 groups of students each use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 balls. We then used these 33 samples to compute 33 proportions. In other words, we repeated / replicated using the shovel 33 times. We can perform this repeated / replicated sampling virtually by once again using our virtual shovel function rep_sample_n(), but by adding the reps = 33 argument. This is telling R that we want to repeat the sampling 33 times.\nWe’ll save these results in a data frame called virtual_samples. We provide a preview of the first 10 rows of virtual_samples below:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1,650 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [33]\n   replicate ball_ID color\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1         1     736 red  \n 2         1    1238 red  \n 3         1    2219 white\n 4         1     412 red  \n 5         1       9 red  \n 6         1      84 white\n 7         1     137 white\n 8         1     536 red  \n 9         1     725 white\n10         1    1598 red  \n# ℹ 1,640 more rows\n\n\nObserve that the first 50 rows of replicate are equal to 1. If you were to continue scrolling through the dataset (like you can in RStudio’s data previewer), you would find that the next 50 rows of replicate are equal to 2. This is telling us that the first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 rows correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all reps = 33 replicates and thus virtual_samples has 33 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 1650 rows.\nLet’s now take virtual_samples and compute the resulting 33 proportions red. We’ll use the same dplyr verbs as before, but this time with an additional group_by() of the replicate variable. Recall from Week 3 that by assigning the grouping variable before we summarize(), we’ll obtain a different summary statistic for each level of our group variable. Thus, we should end up with 33 different proportions, since we have 33 different replicates. We display a preview of the first 10 out of 33 rows:\n\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 2\n   replicate prop_red\n       &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1     0.38\n 2         2     0.32\n 3         3     0.34\n 4         4     0.36\n 5         5     0.3 \n 6         6     0.4 \n 7         7     0.26\n 8         8     0.5 \n 9         9     0.34\n10        10     0.42\n# ℹ 23 more rows\n\n\nAs with our 33 groups of friends’ tactile samples, there is variation in the resulting 33 virtual proportions red. Let’s visualize this variation in a histogram! In Figure 8 we’ve added binwidth = 0.05 and boundary = 0.4 arguments as well. Recall that setting boundary = 0.4 ensures a binning scheme with one of the bins’ boundaries at 0.4. Since the binwidth = 0.05 is also set, this will create bins with boundaries at 0.30, 0.35, 0.45, 0.5, etc. as well.\n\nggplot(data = virtual_prop_red, \n       mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 50 balls that were red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve that we occasionally obtained proportions red that are less than 30%. On the other hand, we occasionally obtained proportions that are greater than 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 35% and 40% (for 11 out of 33 samples). Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of sampling variation.\nLet’s now compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section in Figure 9. Observe that both histograms are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random sampling variation. Furthermore, observe that both distributions are somewhat bell-shaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Comparing 33 virtual and 33 tactile proportions red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Using the virtual shovel 1000 times\nNow say we want to study the effects of sampling variation not for 33 samples, but rather for a larger number of samples, say 1000! We have two choices at this point:\n\nWe could have our groups of friends manually take 1000 samples of 50 balls and compute the corresponding 1000 proportions. This would be a tedious and time-consuming task and would likely leave our friends upset with us.\nWe could use the power of R to automate this repetitive task!\n\nI believe all of us would choose option 2, so let’s abandon tactile sampling in favor of only virtual sampling. Once again let’s use the rep_sample_n() function with sample size set to be 50 once again, but this time with the number of replicates (reps) set to 1000.\n\nvirtual_samples &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl, \n                                size = 50, \n                                reps = 1000, \n                                replace = FALSE)\nvirtual_samples\n\n# A tibble: 50,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1,000]\n   replicate ball_ID color\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1         1    1476 red  \n 2         1    1771 red  \n 3         1    2148 white\n 4         1     257 white\n 5         1    1564 white\n 6         1    2024 white\n 7         1    1406 white\n 8         1     404 white\n 9         1    1310 red  \n10         1     264 white\n# ℹ 49,990 more rows\n\n\nObserve that now virtual_samples has 1000 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 50000 rows, instead of the 33 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 1650 rows from earlier. Using the same data wrangling code as earlier, let’s take the data frame virtual_samples with 1000 \\(\\times\\) 50 = 50,000 rows and compute the resulting 1000 proportions of red balls.\n\nvirtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples %&gt;% \n  group_by(replicate) %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_red = sum(color == \"red\") / 50) \n\nvirtual_prop_red\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   replicate prop_red\n       &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1     0.3 \n 2         2     0.36\n 3         3     0.38\n 4         4     0.4 \n 5         5     0.44\n 6         6     0.38\n 7         7     0.48\n 8         8     0.46\n 9         9     0.38\n10        10     0.3 \n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nObserve that we now have 1000 replicates of prop_red, the proportion of 50 balls that are red. Using the same code as earlier, let’s now visualize the distribution of these 1000 replicates of prop_red in a histogram in Figure 10.\n\nggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 50 balls that were red\", \n       title = \"Distribution of 1000 proportions red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Distribution of 1000 proportions based on 1000 samples of size 50.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the most frequently occurring proportions of red balls occur between 35% and 40%. Every now and then, we obtain proportions as low as between 20% and 25%, and others as high as between 55% and 60%. These are rare, however. Furthermore, observe that we now have a much more symmetric and smoother bell-shaped distribution. This distribution is, in fact, approximated well by a normal distribution. At this point we recommend you read the “Normal distribution” section (Appendix Section 5) for a brief discussion on the properties of the normal distribution.\n\n\n2.4 Using different shovels\nNow say instead of just one shovel, you have three choices of shovels to extract a sample of balls with: shovels of size 25, 50, and 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shovel with 25 slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shovel with 50 slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shovel with 100 slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Three shovels to extract three different sample sizes.\n\n\n\nIf your goal is still to estimate the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red, which shovel would you choose? In our experience, most people would choose the largest shovel with 100 slots because it would yield the “best” guess of the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. Let’s define some criteria for “best” in this subsection.\nUsing our newly developed tools for virtual sampling, let’s unpack the effect of having different sample sizes! In other words, let’s use rep_sample_n() with size set to 25, 50, and 100, respectively, while keeping the number of repeated/replicated samples at 1000:\n\nVirtually use the appropriate shovel to generate 1000 samples with size balls.\nCompute the resulting 1000 replicates of the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red.\nVisualize the distribution of these 1000 proportions red using a histogram.\n\nRun each of the following code segments individually and then compare the three resulting histograms.\n\n# Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------\n# 1.a) Virtually use shovel 1000 times\nvirtual_samples_25 &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl, \n                                   size = 25, \n                                   reps = 1000, \n                                   replace = FALSE)\n\n# 1.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red\nvirtual_prop_red_25 &lt;- virtual_samples_25 %&gt;% \n  group_by(replicate) %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_red = sum(color == \"red\") / 25)\n\n# 1.c) Plot distribution via a histogram\nggplot(data = virtual_prop_red_25, \n       mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 25 balls that were red\") \n\n# Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------\n# 2.a) Virtually use shovel 1000 times\nvirtual_samples_50 &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl, \n                                   size = 50, \n                                   reps = 1000, \n                                   replace = FALSE)\n\n# 2.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red\nvirtual_prop_red_50 &lt;- virtual_samples_50 %&gt;% \n  group_by(replicate) %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_red = sum(color == \"red\") /50) \n\n# 2.c) Plot distribution via a histogram\nggplot(data = virtual_prop_red_50, \n       mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 50 balls that were red\")  \n\n# Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------\n# 3.a) Virtually using shovel with 100 slots 1000 times\nvirtual_samples_100 &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl, \n                                    size = 100, \n                                    reps = 1000)\n\n# 3.b) Compute resulting 1000 replicates of proportion red\nvirtual_prop_red_100 &lt;- virtual_samples_100 %&gt;% \n  group_by(replicate) %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_red = sum(color == \"red\") / 100) \n\n# 3.c) Plot distribution via a histogram\nggplot(data = virtual_prop_red_100, \n       mapping = aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Proportion of 100 balls that were red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) n = 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) n = 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) n = 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes.\n\n\n\n\nFor easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure Figure 12.\nObserve that as the sample size increases, the variation of the 1000 replicates of the proportion of red decreases. In other words, as the sample size increases, there are fewer differences due to sampling variation and the distribution centers more tightly around the same value. Eyeballing Figure 12, all three histograms appear to center around roughly 40%.\nWe can be numerically explicit about the amount of variation in our three sets of 1000 values of prop_red using the standard deviation. A standard deviation is a summary statistic that measures the amount of variation within a numerical variable (see Appendix Section 5) for a brief discussion on the properties of the standard deviation. For all three sample sizes, let’s compute the standard deviation of the 1000 proportions red by running the following data wrangling code that uses the sd() summary function.\n\n# n = 25\nvirtual_prop_red_25 %&gt;% \n  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      sd\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0951\n\n# n = 50\nvirtual_prop_red_50 %&gt;% \n  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      sd\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0689\n\n# n = 100\nvirtual_prop_red_100 %&gt;% \n  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      sd\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0465\n\n\nLet’s compare these three measures of distributional variation in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Comparing standard deviations of proportions red for three different shovels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of slots in shovel\nStandard deviation of proportions red\n\n\n\n\n25\n0.095\n\n\n50\n0.069\n\n\n100\n0.047"

    "text": "3 Sampling framework\nIn both our tactile and our virtual sampling activities, we used sampling for the purpose of estimation. We extracted samples in order to estimate the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. We used sampling as a less time-consuming approach than performing an exhaustive count of all the balls. Our virtual sampling activity built up to the results shown in Figure 12 and Table 1 – comparing 1000 proportions red based on samples of size 25, 50, and 100. This was our first attempt at understanding two key concepts relating to sampling for estimation:\n\nThe effect of sampling variation on our estimates.\nThe effect of sample size on sampling variation.\n\nNow that you have built some intuition relating to sampling, let’s now attach words and labels to the various concepts we’ve explored so far. Specifically in the next section, we’ll introduce terminology and notation as well as statistical definitions related to sampling. This will allow us to succinctly summarize and refer to the ideas behind sampling for the rest of this book.\n\n3.1 Terminology and notation\nLet’s now attach words and labels to the various sampling concepts we’ve seen so far by introducing some terminology and mathematical notation. While they may seem daunting at first, we’ll make sure to tie each of them to sampling bowl activities you performed earlier. Furthermore, throughout this book we’ll give you plenty of opportunity for practice, as the best method for mastering these terms is repetition.\nThe first set of terms and notation relate to populations:\n\nA population is a collection of individuals or observations we are interested in. This is also commonly denoted as a study population. We mathematically denote the population’s size using upper-case \\(N\\).\nA population parameter is some numerical summary about the population that is unknown but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is a mean like the average height of all Canadians, the population parameter of interest is the population mean.\nA census is an exhaustive enumeration or counting of all \\(N\\) individuals in the population. We do this in order to compute the population parameter’s value exactly. Of note is that as the number \\(N\\) of individuals in our population increases, conducting a census gets more expensive (in terms of time, energy, and money).\n\nSo in our sampling activities, the population is the collection of \\(N\\) = 2400 identically sized red and white balls in the bowl shown in Figure 1. Recall that we also represented the bowl “virtually” in the data frame bowl:\n\nbowl\n\n# A tibble: 2,400 × 2\n   ball_ID color\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1       1 white\n 2       2 white\n 3       3 white\n 4       4 red  \n 5       5 white\n 6       6 white\n 7       7 red  \n 8       8 white\n 9       9 red  \n10      10 white\n# ℹ 2,390 more rows\n\n\nThe population parameter here is the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. Whenever we’re interested in a proportion of some value in a population, the population parameter has a specific name: the population proportion. We denote population proportions with the letter \\(p\\). We’ll see later on that we can also consider other types of population parameters, like population means and population slopes.\nIn order to compute this population proportion \\(p\\) exactly, we need to first conduct a census by going through all \\(N\\) = 2400 and counting the number that are red. We then divide this count by 2400 to obtain the proportion red.\nYou might be now asking yourself: “Wait. I understand that performing a census on the actual bowl would take a long time. But can’t we conduct a ‘virtual’ census using the virtual bowl?” You are absolutely correct! In fact when the ModernDive authors created the bowl data frame, they made its contents match the contents of actual bowl not by doing a census, but by reading the contents written on the box the bowl came in!\nLet’s conduct this “virtual” census by using the same dplyr verbs you used earlier to count the number of balls that are red:\n\nsummarize(bowl, \n          total_red = sum(color == \"red\")\n          ) \n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_red\n      &lt;int&gt;\n1       900\n\n\nSince 900 of the 2400 are red, the proportion is 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5%. So we know the value of the population parameter: in our case, the population proportion \\(p\\) is equal to 0.375.\nAt this point, you might be further asking yourself: “If we had a way of knowing that the proportion of the balls that are red is 37.5%, then why did we do any sampling?” Great question! Normally, you wouldn’t do any sampling! However, the sampling activities we did this chapter are merely simulations of how sampling is done in real-life! We perform these simulations in order to study:\n\nThe effect of sampling variation on our estimates.\nThe effect of sample size on sampling variation.\n\nIn real-life sampling not only will the population size \\(N\\) be very large making a census expensive, but sometimes we won’t even know how big the population is! For now however, we press on with our next set of terms and notation.\nThe second set of terms and notation relate to samples:\n\nSampling is the act of collecting a sample from the population, which we generally only do when we can’t perform a census. We mathematically denote the sample size using lower case \\(n\\), as opposed to upper case \\(N\\) which denotes the population’s size. Typically the sample size \\(n\\) is much smaller than the population size \\(N\\). Thus sampling is a much cheaper alternative than performing a census.\nA point estimate, also known as a sample statistic, is a summary statistic computed from a sample that estimates the unknown population parameter.\n\nSo previously we conducted sampling using a shovel with 50 slots to extract samples of size \\(n\\) = 50. To perform the virtual analog of this sampling, recall that we used the rep_sample_n() function as follows:\n\nvirtual_shovel &lt;- rep_sample_n(bowl, \n                               size = 50, \n                               reps = 1, \n                               replace = FALSE)\nvirtual_shovel\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1]\n   replicate ball_ID color\n       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1         1     269 red  \n 2         1       6 white\n 3         1    1580 white\n 4         1    1986 red  \n 5         1    1971 white\n 6         1    1505 red  \n 7         1    1710 white\n 8         1     472 white\n 9         1     883 red  \n10         1     811 white\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nUsing the sample of 50 balls contained in virtual_shovel, we generated an estimate of the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red prop_red\n\nvirtual_shovel %&gt;% \n  summarize(prop_red = sum(color == \"red\") / 50) \n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  replicate prop_red\n      &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     0.36\n\n\nSo in our case, the value of prop_red is the point estimate of the population proportion \\(p\\) since it estimates the latter’s value. Furthermore, this point estimate has a specific name when considering proportions: the sample proportion. It is denoted using \\(\\widehat{p}\\) because it is a common convention in statistics to use a “hat” symbol to denote point estimates.\nThe third set of terms relate to sampling methodology: the method used to collect samples. You’ll see here and throughout the rest of your book that the way you collect samples directly influences their quality.\n\nA sample is said to be representative if it roughly “looks like” the population. In other words, if the sample’s characteristics are a “good” representation of the population’s characteristics.\nWe say a sample is generalizable if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In other words, if we can make “good” guesses about the population using the sample.\nWe say a sampling procedure is biased if certain individuals in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is unbiased if every individual in a population has an equal chance of being sampled.\n\nWe say a sample of \\(n\\) balls extracted using our shovel is representative of the population if it’s contents “roughly resemble” the contents of the bowl. If so, then the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red can generalize to the proportion of the bowl’s \\(N\\) = 2400 balls that are red. Or expressed differently, \\(\\widehat{p}\\) is a “good guess” of \\(p\\). Now say we cheated when using the shovel and removed a number of white balls in favor of red balls. Then this sample would be biased towards red balls, and thus the sample would no longer be representative of the bowl.\nThe fourth and final set of terms and notation relate to the goal of sampling:\n\nOne way to ensure that a sample is unbiased and representative of the population is by using random sampling\nInference is the act of “making a guess” about some unknown. Statistical inference is the act of making a guess about a population using a sample.\n\nIn our case, since the rep_sample_n() function uses your computer’s random number generator, we were in fact performing random sampling.\nLet’s now put all four sets of terms and notation together, keeping our sampling activities in mind:\n\nSince we extracted a sample of \\(n\\) = 50 balls at random, we mixed all of the equally sized balls before using the shovel, then\nthe contents of the shovel are unbiased and representative of the contents of the bowl, thus\nany result based on the shovel can generalize to the bowl, thus\nthe sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the \\(n\\) = 50 balls in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the bowl’s \\(N\\) = 2400 balls that are red, thus\ninstead of conducting a census of the 2400 balls in the bowl, we can infer about the bowl using the sample from the shovel.\n\nWhat you have been performing is statistical inference. This is one of the most important concepts in all of statistics. So much so, we included this term in the title of our book: “Statistical Inference via Data Science”. More generally speaking,\n\nIf the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then\nthe sample is unbiased and representative of the population of size \\(N\\), thus\nany result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus\nthe point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus\ninstead of performing a census, we can infer about the population using sampling.\n\nIn the second reading this week, we’ll introduce the infer package, which makes statistical inference “tidy” and transparent.\n\n\n3.2 Statistical definitions\nTo further attach words and labels to the various sampling concepts we’ve seen so far, we also introduce some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1000 repeated / replicated virtual samples of size \\(n\\) = 25, \\(n\\) = 50, and \\(n\\) = 100 in Section 2, let’s display Figure 12 again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 100\n\n\n\n\n\nThese types of distributions have a special name: sampling distributions of point estimates. Their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of any point estimate, in this case, the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size \\(n\\), we can make statements about what values we can typically expect. Unfortunately, the term sampling distribution is often confused with a sample’s distribution which is merely the distribution of the values in a single sample.\nFor example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around 0.4 = 40%. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions of red balls of 0.2 = 20% when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe a proportion of 20% when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40%. We quantified this variation using the standard deviation of our sample proportions in Table 1, which we display again below:\n\n\n\nPreviously seen comparing standard deviations of proportions red for three different shovels\n\n\nNumber of slots in shovel\nStandard deviation of proportions red\n\n\n\n\n25\n0.095\n\n\n50\n0.069\n\n\n100\n0.047\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the proportion of red balls decreases. This type of standard deviation has another special name: standard error of a point estimate. Standard errors quantify the effect of sampling variation induced on our estimates. In other words, they quantify how much we can expect different proportions of a shovel’s balls that are red to vary from one sample to another sample to another sample, and so on. As a general rule, as sample size increases, the standard error decreases.\nSimilarly to confusion between sampling distributions with a sample’s distribution, people often confuse the standard error with the standard deviation. This is especially the case since a standard error is itself a kind of standard deviation. The best advice we can give is that a standard error is merely a kind of standard deviation: the standard deviation of any point estimate from sampling. In other words, all standard errors are standard deviations, but not every standard deviation is necessarily a standard error.\nTo help reinforce these concepts, let’s re-display Figure 12 but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Figure 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Three sampling distributions of the sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let’s re-display Table 1 but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Standard errors of the sample proportion based on sample sizes of 25, 50, and 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample size (n)\nStandard error of $\\widehat{p}$\n\n\n\n\nn = 25\n0.095\n\n\nn = 50\n0.069\n\n\nn = 100\n0.047\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the key message of this last table: that as the sample size \\(n\\) goes up, the “typical” error of your point estimate will go down, as quantified by the standard error.\n\n\n3.3 The moral of the story\nLet’s recap this section so far. We’ve seen that if a sample is generated at random, then the resulting point estimate is a “good guess” of the true unknown population parameter. In our sampling activities, since we made sure to mix the balls first before extracting a sample with the shovel, the resulting sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) of the shovel’s balls that were red was a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the bowl’s balls that were red.\nHowever, what do we mean by our point estimate being a “good guess”? Sometimes, we’ll get an estimate that is less than the true value of the population parameter, while at other times we’ll get an estimate that is greater. This is due to sampling variation. However, despite this sampling variation, our estimates will “on average” be correct and thus will be centered at the true value. This is because our sampling was done at random and thus in an unbiased fashion.\nIn our sampling activities, sometimes our sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) was less than the true population proportion \\(p\\), while at other times it was greater. This was due to the sampling variability. However, despite this sampling variation, our sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) were “on average” correct and thus were centered at the true value of the population proportion \\(p\\). This is because we mixed our bowl before taking samples and thus the sampling was done at random and thus in an unbiased fashion. This is also known as having an accurate estimate.\nRecall from earlier that the value of the population proportion \\(p\\) of the \\(N\\) = 2400 balls in the bowl was 900/2400 = 0.375 = prop_red * 100%. We computed this value by performing a virtual census of bowl. Let’s re-display our sampling distributions from Figure 12 and Figure 13, but now with a vertical red line marking the true population proportion \\(p\\) of balls that are red = 37.5% in Figure 14. We see that while there is a certain amount of error in the sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) for all three sampling distributions, on average the \\(\\widehat{p}\\) are centered at the true population proportion red \\(p\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Three sampling distributions with population proportion \\(p\\) marked by vertical line.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also saw in this section that as your sample size \\(n\\) increases, your point estimates will vary less and less and be more and more concentrated around the true population parameter. This variation is quantified by the decreasing standard error. In other words, the typical error of your point estimates will decrease. In our sampling exercise, as the sample size increased, the variation of our sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}\\) decreased. You can observe this behavior in Figure 14. This is also known as having a precise estimate.\nSo random sampling ensures our point estimates are accurate, while on the other hand having a large sample size ensures our point estimates are precise. While the terms “accuracy” and “precision” may sound like they mean the same thing, there is a subtle difference. Accuracy describes how “on target” our estimates are, whereas precision describes how “consistent” our estimates are. Figure 15 illustrates the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: “Comparing accuracy and precision.”\n\n\n\nAt this point, you might be asking yourself: “Why did we take 1000 repeated samples of size n = 25, 50, and 100? Shouldn’t we be taking only one sample that’s as large as possible?”. If you did ask yourself these questions, your suspicion is correct! Recall from earlier when we asked ourselves “If we had a way of knowing that the proportion of the balls that are red is 37.5%, then why did we do any sampling?” Similarly, we took 1000 repeated samples as a simulation of how sampling is done in real-life! We used these simulations to study:\n\nThe effect of sampling variation on our estimates.\nThe effect of sample size on sampling variation.\n\nThis is not how sampling is done in real life! In a real-life scenario, we wouldn’t take 1000 repeated/replicated samples, but rather a single sample that’s as large as we can afford. In the next chapter you will read about methods we can use to approximate these sampling distributions, when we have only one sample."

    "section": "4 Central Limit Theorem",
    "text": "4 Central Limit Theorem\nThis chapter began with (virtual) access to a large bowl of balls (our population) and a desire to figure out the proportion of red balls. Despite having access to this population, in reality, you almost never will have access to the population, either because the population is too large, ever changing, or too expensive to take a census of. Accepting this reality means accepting that we need to use statistical inference.\nIn Section 3.1, we stated that “statistical inference is the act of making a guess about a population using a sample.” But how do we do this inference? In the previous section, we defined the sampling framework only to state that in reality we take one large sample, instead of many samples as done in the sampling framework (which we modeled physically by taking many samples from the bowl).\nIn reality, we take only one sample and use that one sample to make statements about the population parameter. This ability of making statements about the population is allowable by a famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the Central Limit Theorem. What you visualized in Figure 12 and Figure 13 and summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 was a demonstration of this theorem. It loosely states that when sample means are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these sample means becomes both more and more normally shaped and more and more narrow.\nIn other words, as our sample size gets larger (1) the sampling distribution of a point estimate (like a sample proportion) increasingly follows a normal distribution and (2) the variation of these sampling distributions gets smaller, as quantified by their standard errors. We discuss the properties of the normal distribution in Appendix Section 5.1.\nShuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created a 3-minute and 38-second video at https://youtu.be/jvoxEYmQHNM explaining this crucial statistical theorem using the average weight of wild bunny rabbits and the average wingspan of dragons as examples. It’s very clever!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\n\nHere’s what is so surprising about the Central Limit Theorem: regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution, the sampling distribution of means (such as the sample mean of bunny weights or the sample mean of the length of dragon wings) and proportions (such as the sample proportion red in our shovels) will be normal. Normal distributions are defined by where they are centered and how wide they are, and the Central Limit Theorem gives us both:\n\nThe sampling distribution of the point estimate is centered at the true population parameter\nWe have an estimate for how wide the sampling distribution of the point estimate is, given by the standard error (which we will discuss in the next chapter on confidence intervals)\n\nWhat the Central Limit Theorem creates for us is a ladder between a single sample and the population. By the Central Limit Theorem, we can say that (1) our sample’s point estimate is drawn from a normal distribution centered at the true population parameter and (2)that the width of that normal distribution is governed by the standard error of our point estimate. Relating this to our bowl, if we pull one sample and get the sample proportion of red balls \\(\\widehat{p}\\), this value of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) is drawn from the normal curve centered at the true population proportion of red balls \\(p\\) with the computed standard error."

    "text": "5 Appendix\n\n5.1 Normal distribution\nLet’s review one specific distribution: the Normal Distribution. Bell shaped distributions like the Normal Distribution are defined by two values: (1) the mean \\(\\mu\\) (“mu”) which locates the center of the distribution and (2) the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) (“sigma”) which determines the variation of the distribution. In Figure 17, we plot three normal distributions where:\n\nThe solid normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 5\\) & standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\).\nThe dotted normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 5\\) & standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 5\\).\nThe dashed normal curve has mean \\(\\mu = 15\\) & standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Three normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the solid and dotted line Normal Distributions have the same center due to their common mean \\(\\mu\\) = 5. However, the dotted line normal curve is wider due to its larger standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\) = 5. On the other hand, the solid and dashed line normal curves have the same variation due to their common standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 2. However, they are centered at different locations.\nWhen the mean \\(\\mu\\) = 0 and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 1, the normal distribution has a special name. It’s called the Standard Normal Distribution or the \\(z\\)-curve.\nFurthermore, if a variable follows a normal curve, there are three rules of thumb we can use:\n\n68% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 1 standard deviation of the mean.\n95% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 1.96 \\(\\approx\\) 2 standard deviations of the mean.\n99.7% of values will lie within \\(\\pm\\) 3 standard deviations of the mean.\n\nLet’s illustrate this on a standard normal curve in Figure 18. The dashed lines are at -3, -1.96, -1, 0, 1, 1.96, and 3. These 7 lines cut up the x-axis into 8 segments. The areas under the normal curve for each of the 8 segments are marked and add up to 100%. For example:\n\nThe middle two segments represent the interval -1 to 1. The shaded area above this interval represents 34% + 34% = 68% of the area under the curve. In other words, 68% of values.\nThe middle four segments represent the interval -1.96 to 1.96. The shaded area above this interval represents 13.5% + 34% + 34% + 13.5% = 95% of the area under the curve. In other words, 95% of values.\nThe middle six segments represent the interval -3 to 3. The shaded area above this interval represents 2.35% + 13.5% + 34% + 34% + 13.5% + 2.35% = 99.7% of the area under the curve. In other words, 99.7% of values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Rules of thumb about areas under normal curves."

Many organisms follow Bergmann’s rule, including insects, birds, snakes, marine invertebrates, and &gt; terrestrial and marine mammals. What drives Bergmann’s rule? Bergmann originally hypothesized that the organisms he studied, birds, were larger in the colder, higher latitudes due to heat-conservation. But the heat-conservation hypothesis relies on internal regulation of body temperature and therefore does not apply to ectotherms, some of which also follow Bergmann’s rule.”"

Ice cover duration is the number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again. Lakes Monona and Wingra are considered to be frozen if they are completely ice covered, while Lake Mendota is considered to be frozen if there is ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and more than 50% of the lake is covered by ice."

The more specific you define the question of interest here, the easier the rest of the analysis and report will be. The research questions should start with, “What is the relationship between…” and should be as specific as possible. Your Discussion section should directly address the question(s) you pose here.\n\n\n\nMethods\nThis section should lay out the steps, decisions, and logic leading to the statistical model you will use to answer the research question of interest.\n\nDescribe the response and explanatory variables, how they were measured and their associated units. For categorical variables, describe the levels of the categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may need to look up the publication(s) the data are associated with to obtain information on how each variable was measured by the researchers.\n\n\n\nProduce data visualizations exploring the relationship(s) you are interested in investigating, contrasting the need for a second explanatory variable.\n\nFor a multiple linear regression with one numerical variable and one categorical variable, you should produce two visualizations, (1) a scatterplot where each group has a regression line with its own slope (interaction model), and (2) a scatterplot where every group has parallel regression lines (parallel slopes model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery visualization should have nicely formatted axis labels!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe what you see in the visualizations, making direct references to the plots!

Be specific about why the method being used are appropriate for the investigation at hand making direct reference to the visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding on a Statistical Model\n\n\n\nThe statistical model you fit in the next section depends on what you see in your visualization.

Similar to before, I’ve provided you with some code to get you started, but you need to write the remaining code.\n\nget_regression_summaries(one_rank)\nget_regression_summaries(one_ethnicity)\nget_regression_summaries(one_gender)\nget_regression_summaries(one_language)\nget_regression_summaries(one_age)\nget_regression_summaries(one_perc_eval)\nget_regression_summaries(one_level)\n\n## Now, you need to compare the other seven models! \n\n1. What model was your top model? Specifically, which variable was selected to be included?\n\n\nStep 2 - Adding a Second Variable\nAlright, you’ve added one variable, the next step is to decide if you should add a second variable. This process looks nearly identical to the previous step, with one major change: every model you fit needs to contain the variable you decided to add. So, if you decided to add the bty_avg variable, every model you fit would look like this:\nname_of_model &lt;- lm(score ~ bty_avg + &lt;variable&gt;, data = evals)\nAgain, the name of the model will need to change. This round, you are on your own – I’ve provided you with no code. Here are my recommendations:\n\nname each model two_ followed by the names of both variables included in the model (e.g., two_bty_id)\ngo through each variable step-by-step just like you did before\n\n\n## Code to fit all 13 models that add a second variable to your top model goes here!\n\nAlright, now you should have 13 more models to compare! Like before, you need to inspect the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values to see which of these 13 models is the “top” model.\nRules: You can only add a variable to the model if it improves adjusted \\(R^2\\) by at least 2% (0.02) from the model you chose in Question 1.\n\n## Code to compare all 13 models you fit goes here!\n\n2. What model was your top model? State which variables are included in the model you chose!\n\n\nStep 3 - Adding a Third Variable\nAs you might have expected, in this step we add a third variable to our top model from the previous step. This process should be getting familiar at this point!\nThis process of fitting 12-14 models at a time is getting rather tedious! So, I’ve written some code that will carry out this process for us in one pipeline! The only thing you need to change is:\n\nadd in the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1 & 2 in the ~lm(score ~ .x + &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt;, data = evals) step\nadd in the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1 & 2 in the select(-ID, -score, -&lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt;, -&lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt;) step\n\nFor example, if you chose gender and age in Steps 1 and 2, your code on the first line would look like map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + gender + age, data = evals)) %&gt;% and your code on the fourth line would look like select(-score, -gender, -age) %&gt;%.\nYour turn!\n\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt; in line 2 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1 & 2\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt; and &lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt; in line 4 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1 & 2\n\nevals %&gt;% \n  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt;, data = evals)) %&gt;% \n  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %&gt;% \n  select(-score, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt;, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt;\n           ) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"variable\", \n               values_to = \"adj_r_sq\") %&gt;% \n  slice_max(adj_r_sq)\n\nThe output of this code is the variable that has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\). Compare this value to the value of your “top” model from Step 2 and see if it improved adjusted \\(R^2\\) by at least 2% (0.02). If so, this variable should be added. If not, then your model from Step 2 is the “best” model!\n3. What model was your top model? State which variables are included in the model you chose!\n\n\nStep 4 - Adding a Fourth Variable\nIf you decided to add a variable in Step 3, then you keep going! If you didn’t add a variable in Step 3, then you stop!\n\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt; in line 2 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1, 2, & 3\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt; and &lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt; in line 4 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1, 2 & 3\n\nevals %&gt;% \n  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt;, data = evals)) %&gt;% \n  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %&gt;% \n  select(-score, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt;, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt;, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 3 SELECTED&gt;\n         ) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"variable\", \n               values_to = \"adj_r_sq\") %&gt;% \n  slice_max(adj_r_sq)\n\nThe output of this code is the variable that has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\). Compare this value to the value of your “top” model from Step 3 and see if it improved adjusted \\(R^2\\) by at least 2% (0.02). If so, this variable should be added. If not, then your model from Step 3 is the “best” model!\n4. What model was your top model? You must state which variables are included in the model you chose!\n\n\nStep 5 - Adding a Fifth Variable\nIf you decided to add a variable in Step 4, then you keep going! If you didn’t add a variable in Step 4, then you stop!\n\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt; in line 2 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1, 2, 3 & 4\n## Change the &lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt; and &lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt; in line 4 to the names of the variables you selected in Steps 1, 2, 3 & 4\n\nevals %&gt;% \n  map(.f = ~lm(score ~ .x + &lt;VARIABLES SELECTED&gt;, data = evals)) %&gt;% \n  map_df(.f = ~get_regression_summaries(.x)$adj_r_squared) %&gt;% \n  select(-score, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 1 SELECTED&gt;, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 2 SELECTED&gt;, \n         -&lt;VARIABLE 3 SELECTED&gt;,\n         -&lt;VARIABLE 4 SELECTED&gt;\n          ) %&gt;%  \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), \n               names_to = \"variable\", \n               values_to = \"adj_r_sq\") %&gt;% \n  slice_max(adj_r_sq)\n\nThe output of this code is the variable that has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\). Compare this value to the value of your “top” model from Step 4 and see if it improved adjusted \\(R^2\\) by at least 2% (0.02). If so, this variable should be added. If not, then your model from Step 4 is the “best” model!\n5. What model was your top model? You must state which variables are included in the model you chose!"

    "text": "Adding Categorical Variables\nWhen we are interested in comparing the distribution of a numerical variable across groups of a categorical variable, we “typically” see people use faceted histograms or side-by-side boxplots. I believe an unsung hero of these types of comparisons is the ridge plot.\nAs introduced in Introduction to Modern Statistics, a ridge plot essentially has multiple density plots stacked in the same plotting window. A key feature of ridge plots is a categorical variable is always on the y-axis, with a numeric variable on the x-axis.\nIn R, we use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package to create a ridge plot. Yes, this is new, but don’t worry! The function has the same layout as things you’ve seen before.\nQuestion 7 – Fill in the code below to create a ridge plot comparing the lengths of Cutthroat trout between the different types of channels (unittype). Be sure to add nice axis labels to your plot, which describe the variables being plotted (and their units)!\n\nggplot(data = trout, \n       mapping = aes(x = &lt;NUMERICAL VARIABLE&gt;, \n                     y = &lt;CATEGORICAL VARIABLE&gt;)\n       ) +\n  geom_density_ridges() \n\nQuestion 8 – Modify your plot from #7 to incorporate the section of the forest into your plot, using either color or facets. Hint: The fill aesthetic will fill the ridge plots with color (rather than just the outline).\nQuestion 9 – Based on your plot, how different are the lengths of the Cutthroat trout between the different channel types and forest sections? Be sure to address how the centers and shapes of ALL these distributions compare!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a Quarto document!\nQuarto is a software that allows you to interweave text and R code to create HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents\nThere are two ways to view a Quarto document, (1) as the “Source” file, or (2) as the “Visual” file. We will only use the Visual option in this class, as it allows you to interact with Quarto similar to how you interact with Word or Google Docs.\n\n\nSimilar to a Word Doc, there are a variety of ways you can spice up a Quarto document! Let’s explore a few.\nQuestion 1: Using the formatting options, make a numbered list of your top three favorite animals.\nQuestion 2: Using the formatting options, insert an image of your favorite animal.\nQuestion 3: Now, change the “Formatting your Document” section name to “My Favorite Animals”. Make sure your header is a level 1 – use the Header 1 formatting option!\n\n\n\nYou can differentiate the R code within a Quarto file from the body of the document, based on the gray boxes that start with an {r}.\nHere is an example of an R code chunk:\nNotice in the line after the {r} there are two lines that start with #| – this is the symbol that declares options for a code chunk. The #| label: allows us to specify a name for a code chunk, I typically choose a name that tells me what the code chunk does (e.g., load-packages, clean-data). The #| include: false option at the beginning of the code chunk controls how the code output looks in our final rendered document.\nThis code chunk has two things we want to pay attention to:\n\nThe library(tidyverse) code loads in an R package called the “tidyverse”. This is code you will have in every lab assignment for this class!\nCode comments which are denoted by a # symbol. Code comments are a way for you (and me) to write what the code is doing, without R thinking what we are writing is code it should execute.\n\n\n\n\nIn order for us to be able to use the contents of the tidyverse package (e.g., data, functions), we need to run the code chunk above! There are a few ways to do this:\n\nClicking on the green “play” button in the upper right hand corner of the document. This will run all the code included in the code chunk.\nPutting your cursor in the code chunk and using a keyboard shortcut to run the code. On a PC the shortcut is Control + Enter (pressed at the same time). On a Mac the shortcut is Command + Return. This will run a single line of code, so you may need to do this multiple times is there is more than one line of code!\n\nQuestion 4: Run the code in the above code chunk (load-packages) using either of these methods. What output do you see? What do you think this output is telling you?\n\n\n\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Rendering a document is similar to running the code within the document, as Quarto performs the same action (running each chunk of code) in order to render your final document.\nQuestion 5: Click on the “Render” button to produce an HTML file (you may need to enable popups to see the rendered document). Do you see the above code chunk (load-packages) in the rendered HTML document? Why do you think this is the case?\n\n\n\nYou can include code output in your rendered document:\n\nmpg\n\nQuestion 6: Run the code above to see a preview of the mpg dataset. What are the observations (cases) in these data?\n\nglimpse(mpg)\n\nWe can also preview a dataset using the glimpse() function.\nQuestion 7: Run the code above and compare the output to the previous code (mpg). How is the output different? Which output do you prefer?\n\n\n\nYou can also embed plots in the rendered document. Here is an example of a plot:\nQuestion 8: What do you think the echo: false option does in the above code chunk? Hint: Render the document and see what you see!\nQuestion 9: What do you think the mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) code does?\nQuestion 10: What do you think the labs(x = \"Highway Miles Per Gallon\", y = \"Car Manufacturer\") code does?"

This will run all the code included in the code chunk.\nPutting your cursor in the code chunk and using a keyboard shortcut to run the code. On a PC the shortcut is Control + Enter (pressed at the same time). On a Mac the shortcut is Command + Return. This will run a single line of code, so you may need to do this multiple times is there is more than one line of code!\n\nQuestion 4: Run the code in the above code chunk (load-packages) using either of these methods.

    "section": "3.1 Choosing an Article",
    "text": "3.1 Choosing an Article\n\nTo save everyone time spent hunting for an interesting scientific article that has both visualizations and statistical methods taught in this course, I’ve gone ahead and found three articles from different contexts:\n\nSensitivity and Specificity of a Novel Classifier for the Early Diagnosis of Dengue\n\nAbstract:\nDengue is a very common acute infectious disease in the tropical world. Health care professionals are able to better care for dengue patients if they can make an early diagnosis and make a plan for case management. This article investigated fever in 5729 children in Vietnam with 3 days or less of fever and identified 1692 dengue cases using advanced methods. We systematically collected a range of medical and laboratory findings on each patient when they entered the study and used statistical tools to determine if these medical and laboratory findings could enable early diagnosis, independent of sophisticated, gold-standard laboratory tests. Our results, called the Early Dengue Classifier, had performance characteristics suggesting it could improve the diagnostic proficiency of health care professionals. However the performance of the Early Dengue Classifier is not perfect and likely will not change the practice of experienced doctors in dengue endemic settings. Our study highlights the need for 2nd generation, easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately diagnose dengue in the first few days of fever.\n\nAI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking\n\nAbstract:\nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has transformed numerous aspects of daily life, yet its impact on critical thinking remains under explored. This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and critical thinking skills, focusing on cognitive offloading as a mediating factor. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 666 participants across diverse age groups and educational backgrounds. Quantitative data were analysed using ANOVA and correlation analysis, while qualitative insights were obtained through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased cognitive offloading. Younger participants exhibited higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking scores compared to older participants. Furthermore, higher educational attainment was associated with better critical thinking skills, regardless of AI usage. These results highlight the potential cognitive costs of AI tool reliance, emphasizing the need for educational strategies that promote critical engagement with AI technologies. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI’s cognitive implications, offering practical recommendations for mitigating its adverse effects on critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of fostering critical thinking in an AI-driven world, making this research essential reading for educators, policymakers, and technologists."

Each week, you will read the required chapter(s), completing a required reading guide to walk you through the central concepts for each week. You are required to submit your completed reading guides by the start of class on Monday.\n\n\nConcept quizzes (every week)\nEach week there will be a short (~10 questions) quiz over the reading and videos from the week. These quizzes are intended to ensure that you grasped the key concepts from the week’s readings. The quizzes are not timed, so you can feel free to check your answers with the textbook and / or videos if you so wish. The quizzes are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You are required to complete the concept quiz by the start of class on Monday.\n\n\nTutorials (every week)\nYou can think of the tutorials as an “interactive” textbook, as they interweave statistical ideas alongside examples of how to work with data in R and hands-on exercises writing the R code necessary to complete a given task. Each exercise has hints available if you get stuck!\nThe tutorials are work at your own pace, so you can complete them all at once or slowly throughout the week. The lab assignments will require for you to put the skills you learned in the tutorials to work, so you are required to complete each week’s tutorial before Wednesday’s lab.\nThe tutorials are marked on completion as complete or incomplete. You will submit a screenshot of the completion page at the end of the tutorial to confirm that you completed the tutorial for the week. You are required to complete the tutorial by the start of class on Thursday.",

Lab assignments will require for you to work through the tutorial for the week, thus the tutorials are due before the start of class on Wednesday.\nYou will complete the lab assignments in the same teams you collaborate with in class. You will access the lab assignment through Posit Cloud, which you will be walked through during the first lab. Your group will be expected to submit your completed lab on Canvas. You will need to submit only the HTML document (not the Quarto document). The individual assigned as the Report Manager (described below) will submit the team’s completed Lab assignment by Monday at 5pm.\n\nSuccess / Growing Grading\nI expect that you will approach each lab assignment seriously, investing the necessary time and energy to prepare your responses. Different from what you may have experienced, lab assignments are graded for “proficiency” of specific learning targets, which describe what you should be able to do after taking this course. You’ll receive a score for each problem on an assignment according to the Success / Not Yet rubric below, as well as feedback to help you improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nJustification\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nThe solution to the problem is correct, legible, and easy to follow, with all reasoning provided. Any error does not bring into question your understanding of the topic.\n\n\nGrowing\nThe solution shows growth toward mastering the topic; however, elements of the solution bring into question your understanding of the topic, and thus further attention is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting Revisions\nEvery week, your Lab assignment and / or Statistical Critique from the previous week will be graded and returned to you no later than Wednesday at 9am. Meaning, Lab 2 (completed in Week 2) will be graded and returned to you by Wednesday of Week 3. After the first submission of your Lab or Critique you will have the option to retry any problems for which you scored a Growing (G). A written reflection on how your understanding of the problem changed will accompany any revision.\nRevisions for a Lab or Critique are due on Wednesdays at 5pm, one week from when they were returned. If you do not complete your revision within one week of when it was returned, you are no longer permitted to submit a revision. If you don’t earn a Success by your second revision, you are expected to make an appointment with me to meet during my office hours (or another agreed-upon time) to create a reassessment strategy.\n\n\nReflections on Your Learning\nRevisions must include a reflection describing how you revised your thinking when completing your revision. It’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—you have to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from an introductory statistics class, but I think you’ll get the idea.\n\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of who has outstanding revisions.\n\n\n\nPeer Evaluations\nFor quite some time I have been interested in what we, as your professors, can do to make group collaborations better for every student.\nFollowing the lab assignment each week you are required to complete a short (4-question) survey regarding your experiences collaborating with your partner. I use these evaluations to gauge people’s collaborative experiences and to identify any instances where it would be beneficial to change groups or meet 1-1 with group members.\nOn Wednesdays, I will bring personalized paper evaluation slips (with your name on it) to class. Once your group has finished the lab, you can come up and grab your evaluation slip. I ask that you take 3-minutes to thoughtfully respond to each of the questions. Your responses do not influence your grade or your partner’s grade, but I ask that you take them seriously.",

We will explore these ideas using concepts you have seen before: hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. We will visit the ideas of p-values and significance testing, with a emphasis on making (and justifying) sound scientific decisions with the intention of obtaining the best regression model we can.\nReading: Supplementary resources written / compiled by Dr. Theobold",

The best way to obtain information about the dataset is using the glimpse() function!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2 – Scatterplot\nSuccess: Code should look like the following\n\nggplot(data = ntl_icecover, \n       mapping = aes(y = ice_duration, x = year)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Ice Duration (days)\")\n\nGrowing:\n\nDoesn’t change y-axis labels\n\nFeedback: You were asked to give your visualization nice axis labels. Also, it is important for the axis label to contain the units of the variable. What unit was ice duration measured in?\n\nSwaps the x- and y-variable\n\nFeedback: Careful! Which variable is supposed to be the response?\n\n\nQuestion 3 – Describe the regression line\nSuccess: Addresses form, direction, strength and unusual points.\n\nForm: Linear\nDirection: Negative\nStrength: Moderate\nOutliers: Maybe the 2001 observation with ~20 days of ice?\n\nGrowing:\n\nIf they don’t discuss one of the for aspects.\n\nFeedback: You were asked to describe the form, direction, strength, and unusual points. Make sure you discuss all four aspects!\n\nIf they say there are unusual points / outliers but don’t say where. The description should point to the exact x and y location (not just one or the other).\n\nFeedback: If you believe there are unusual observations you need to tell the reader where these points are, which includes both their x- and y-coordinates!\n\n\nQuestion 4 – Add a regression line\nSuccess:\n\nIncludes regression line with geom_smooth() and method = \"lm\" option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThey don’t need to turn the standard errors off (se = FALSE), but that’s fine if they did!\n\n\nGrowing:\n\nIf they do not add regression line\n\nFeedback: For this question you needed to add a regression line to the previous scatterplot!\n\nIf they do not use method = \"lm\" to get straight line\n\nFeedback: You need to have a straight line, not a wiggly line! Take a look at the R resources to see how you specify a straight line!\n\n\nQuestion 5 – Find correlation\nSuccess: Code should look like the following\n\nget_correlation(data = ntl_icecover, \n                ice_duration ~ year, \n                na.rm = TRUE)\n\nGrowing:\n\nDoesn’t remove NAs\n\nFeedback: It is important to remove the NAs before calculation the correlation! Is there another argument (input) for the get_correlation() function that allows you to remove the missing values? Hint: it looks like the option we used to remove missing values in the mean() function in Week 3!\n\n\nQuestion 6 – Fit linear regression\nSuccess: Code should look like the following\n\nmy_model &lt;- lm(ice_duration ~ year, data = ntl_icecover)\n\nGrowing:\n\nSwaps response and explanatory\n\nFeedback: Careful! With the lm() function the response variable goes first (before the ~) and the explanatory comes second (after the ~). Which variable were you instructed to use as the response?\nWhen you make this change, your coefficient table (and resulting interpretations) will change! These changes to Questions 8, 9, 10, and 11 should be included in your revisions.\n\n\nQuestion 7 – Get regression table\nSuccess: Code should look like the following\n\nget_regression_table(my_model)\n\nGrowing:\n\nDoesn’t use the get_regression_table() function\n\nFeedback: We want out model output to look tidy, which is why we use the get_regression_table() function!\n\n\nQuestion 8 – Write out regression equation\nSuccess:\n\\[ \\widehat{\\text{ice duration}} = 495 - 0.203 \\times (\\text{year})\\]\n\nIndicates the response (ice duration) is estimated / predicted / the mean with either a hat or with language\nInputs values in correct location\nReferences year and ice duration (not x and y)\n\nGrowing:\n\nDoes not indicate the response (ice duration) is estimated / predicted / the mean\n\nFeedback: Remember, the estimated regression equation has a hat over y. What does that hat mean? How can you incorporate that language into your interpretation?\n\nUses x and y instead of variable names\n\nFeedback: When writing out the regression equation, you need to reference the context of the line that was found. What variable was the response? What variable was the explanatory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf they use x and y in the equation but then define what variables they are associated with, that is okay!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9 – Interpret slope\nSuccess:\n\nCorrect interpretation of slope for 1 year increase\n\n1 year increase\nmean / predicted / estimated ice duration\ndecreases by 0.203 days\n\n\nGrowing:\n\n\n\nDoesn’t interpret the value of -0.203\n\nFeedback: Careful! You did not interpret what the value of -0.203 means in the context of the regression line!\n\nStates the duration of ice increases\n\nFeedback: Look at the sign associated with the slope coefficient! What does the sign tell you about whether ice duration should increase or decrease?\n\nDoesn’t indicate the response is mean / estimate / predicted ice duration\n\nFeedback: Careful! Your interpretation sounds like it is guaranteed that every 1 year increase in time will result in exactly a 0.203 day decrease in ice duration. Will there always be exactly this decrease? How do we indicate that our slope estimate is not exact?\n\nUses the word “cause”\n\nFeedback: The word “cause” in statistics means a very specific thing. We can only use cause and effect statements in an experiment. Was this study an experiment? If not, what word would be more appropriate to use?\n\n\nQuestion 10 – 100 Year Increase\n\nCorrect interpretation of slope for 100 year increase\n\n100 year increase\nmean / predicted / estimated / approximate ice duration\ndecreases by 20.3 days\n\n\nGrowing:\n\nDidn’t use language indicating that 20.3 is an expected / estimated / predicted amount\n\nFeedback: See feedback for Q9, and integrate into this problem, too!\n\nUses y-intercept when increasing 100 years\n\nFeedback: Careful! Look back at your interpretation for Question 9. Did you include the y-intercept when you interpreted the value of the slope? How can you translate what you did in Question 9 to an increase of 100 years instead of 1 year?\n\nDon’t provide an estimate of the change\n\nFeedback: You need to use your estimated regression equation to state what the expected change in the ice duration would be if the number of years was increased by 100.\n\n\nQuestion 11 – Multivariate plot\nSuccess: Code should look like the following\n\nggplot(data = ntl_icecover, \n       mapping = aes(y = ice_duration, x = year, color = \"lakeid\")) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Ice Duration (days)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat Issues from Question 4\n\n\n\nIf they got a Growing for Question 4 from using a wiggly line, they don’t need to get a Growing here!\nIf they got a Growing for Question 2 for forgetting units on the y-axis, they don’t need to get a Growing here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they don’t relabel their legend\n\n\n\nNice job adding color to your plot! Technically, we can also change the title of the legend inside the labs() function! All you would need to do is add another line that says color = \"Lake in Madison, WI\".\n\n\n\n\nGrowing:\n\nIf they use fill instead of color\n\nFeedback: I know it is confusing, but to change the color of the points and the lines in a scatterplot we need to use the color aesthetic, not the fill."

    "text": "SFO Destinations\nOne of the variables refers to the destination (i.e. airport) of the flight, which have three letter abbreviations. For example, flights into Los Angeles have a dest of \"LAX\", flights into San Francisco have a dest of \"SFO\", and flights into Chicago (O’Hare) have a dest of \"ORD\".\nIf you want to visualize only on delays of flights headed to Los Angeles, you need to first filter() the data for flights with that destination (e.g., filter(dest == \"LAX\")) and then make a histogram of the departure delays of only those flights.\nLogical operators: Filtering for certain observations (e.g. flights from a particular airport) is often of interest in data frames where we might want to examine observations with certain characteristics separately from the rest of the data. To do so, you can use the filter() function and a series of logical operators. The most commonly used logical operators for data analysis are as follows:\n\n== means “equal to”\n!= means “not equal to”\n&gt; or &lt; means “greater than” or “less than”\n&gt;= or &lt;= means “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to”\n\nQuestion 4 – Fill in the code to create a new dataframe named sfo_flights that is the result of filter()ing only the observations whose destination was San Francisco.\n\nsfo_flights &lt;- filter(nycflights, \n                      dest == )\n\n\nMultiple Data Filters\nYou can filter based on multiple criteria! Within the filter() function, each criteria is separated using commas. For example, suppose you are interested in flights leaving from LaGuardia (LGA) in February:\n\nfilter(nycflights, \n       origin == \"LGA\", \n       month == 2)\n\n## Remember months are coded as numbers (February = 2)!\n\nNote that you can separate the conditions using commas if you want flights that are both leaving from LGA and flights in February. If you are interested in either flights leaving from LGA or flights that happened in February, you can use the | instead of the comma.\nQuestion 5 – Fill in the code below to find the number of flights flying into SFO in July that arrived early.\n\nfilter(sfo_flights, \n       month == __, \n       arr_delay &gt; __) %&gt;% \n  glimpse()\n\nQuestion 6 – When you ran the code above output a preview of the filtered dataset.

These data are stored in the ntl_icecover dataset, which lives in the lterdatsampler package.\nAccording to the EPA, lake ice duration can be an indicator of climate change. This is because lake ice is dependent on several environmental factors, so changes in these factors will influence the formation of ice on top of lakes. As a result, the study and analysis of lake ice formation can inform scientists about how quickly the climate is changing, and are critical to minimizing disruptions to lake ecosystems."

    "section": "Statistical Model",
    "text": "Statistical Model\nFor our analysis we will be using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. An ANOVA is an appropriate statistical model as we have a continuous response variable (grade 8 math score) and categorical explanatory variables (year, continent). Year is not considered to be a continuous numerical variable as we have only four measurements in time (1996, 1999, 2003, 2007).\n\nModel Conditions\nAn ANOVA has model conditions that are very similar to what we learned for linear regression. In this section we will evaluate the conditions of the model.\nFor this section, it might be helpful to know how many observations there are for each year and for each continent. I have written code below to provide you with a table of these numbers:\n\ncount(math_scores, continent, year) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = continent, \n              values_from = n, \n              values_fill = 0) %&gt;% \n  janitor::adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\", \"col\"))\n\n\nIndependence\nBased on the table we know:\n\neach year has measurements on about six continents\neach continent has measurements for about four years\n\nUse this information to evaluate the condition of independence of observations.\nQuestion 7 – Is it reasonable to assume that the observations within a continent are independent of each other?\nQuestion 8 – Is it reasonable to assume that the observations within a year are independent of each other?\nQuestion 9 – Is it reasonable to assume that the observations between continents are independent of each other?\nQuestion 10 – Is it reasonable to assume that the observations between a years are independent of each other?\n\n\nNormality\nNow we will evaluate the normality of the the distributions of grade 8 math scores across years and across continents – the plot you created in #5. Keep in mind, the normality condition is very important when the sample sizes for each group are relatively small.\nQuestion 11 – Is it reasonable to say that the grade 8 math scores across the four years and six continents are normally distributed?\n\n\nEqual Variance\nNow we will evaluate the normality of the the distributions of grade 8 math scores across years and across continents – the plot you created in #5. Keep in mind, the constant variance condition is especially important when the sample sizes differ between groups.\nFor this section, it might be helpful to know the standard deviations for each year / continent combo. I have written code below to provide you with a table of these numbers:\nKeep in mind a standard deviation of NA can happen for two reasons, (1) there is no data, or (2) there is only one observation.\n\nmath_scores %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, continent) %&gt;% \n  summarize(var = var(grade_8_math_score, na.rm = TRUE)\n            ) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = continent, values_from = var)\n\nLooking at the table, we can see that the largest variance of 10257 (North America, 2007) is nearly 27 times larger than the smallest variance of 381 (Europe, 2003). That’s a lot! So, our equal variance condition is definitely violated.\nBut, we have learned tools to attempt to remedy this issue! Let’s take the log of grade_8_math_score and see how the variances compare.\n\nmath_scores %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, continent) %&gt;% \n  summarize(log_var = var(log(grade_8_math_score))\n            ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = continent, values_from = log_var)\n\nQuestion 12 – Based on the variances in the table above, is it reasonable to say that the log grade 8 math scores across the four years and six continents have equal variability?"

    "text": "A Word About Reflections\n\n\nWhen I initially answered question 6, I believed “observations” were the variables used to classify each column in the data frame. Therefore, I believed the answer to be manufacturer, model, year, etc., or the column headers. However, after analyzing the data again and looking over the reading, I learned that “observations” or “cases” actually refer to the subjects that the data is collected on. In this instance, the data set presents information on cars, and that is why the observations/cases would actually be cars. It is important to be able to distinguish between cases and variables because that is how we can correctly analyze our data and prevent errors in our interpretations."

    "text": "1 Model Selection\nThe best model is not always the most complicated. Sometimes including variables that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions. This week, we will learn about model selection strategies – strategies which can help us eliminate variables from the model that are found to be less important. It’s common (and hip, at least in the statistical world) to refer to models that have undergone such variable pruning as parsimonious.\nIn practice, the model that includes all available predictors is often referred to as the full model. The full model may not be the best model, and if it isn’t, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable.\nIn Section 6.3.1 of ModernDive, you used visualizations to compare an interaction model (different slopes) with a parallel slopes model. In the figures below, both the parallel slope and the interaction model attempt to explain \\(y =\\) the average math SAT score for various high schools in Massachusetts.\nWhen comparing the left and right-hand plots below, we observed that the three lines corresponding to small, medium, and large high schools were not that different. Given this similarity, we stated it could be argued that the “simpler” parallel slopes model should be favored.\n# Interaction model\nggplot(MA_schools, \n       aes(x = perc_disadvan, y = average_sat_math, color = size)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Percent economically disadvantaged\", y = \"Math SAT Score\", \n       color = \"School size\", title = \"Interaction model\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n# Parallel slopes model\nggplot(MA_schools, \n       aes(x = perc_disadvan, y = average_sat_math, color = size)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +\n  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Percent economically disadvantaged\", y = \"Math SAT Score\", \n       color = \"School size\", title = \"Parallel slopes model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 1 and Table 2, we observed that the interaction model was “more complex” in that the regression table had six (6) rows versus the four (4) rows of the parallel slopes model.\n\nsat_interaction &lt;- lm(average_sat_math ~ perc_disadvan * size, \n                          data = MA_schools)\nget_regression_table(sat_interaction)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Interaction model coefficient estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd_error\nstatistic\np_value\nlower_ci\nupper_ci\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n594.327\n13.288\n44.726\n0.000\n568.186\n620.469\n\n\nperc_disadvan\n-2.932\n0.294\n-9.961\n0.000\n-3.511\n-2.353\n\n\nsize: medium\n-17.764\n15.827\n-1.122\n0.263\n-48.899\n13.371\n\n\nsize: large\n-13.293\n13.813\n-0.962\n0.337\n-40.466\n13.880\n\n\nperc_disadvan:sizemedium\n0.146\n0.371\n0.393\n0.694\n-0.585\n0.877\n\n\nperc_disadvan:sizelarge\n0.189\n0.323\n0.586\n0.559\n-0.446\n0.824\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsat_parallel_slopes &lt;- lm(average_sat_math ~ perc_disadvan + size, \n                              data = MA_schools)\nget_regression_table(sat_parallel_slopes)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Parallel slopes model coefficient estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd_error\nstatistic\np_value\nlower_ci\nupper_ci\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n588.190\n7.607\n77.325\n0.000\n573.226\n603.154\n\n\nperc_disadvan\n-2.777\n0.106\n-26.120\n0.000\n-2.986\n-2.568\n\n\nsize: medium\n-11.913\n7.535\n-1.581\n0.115\n-26.736\n2.909\n\n\nsize: large\n-6.362\n6.923\n-0.919\n0.359\n-19.981\n7.258\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this reading, we’ll mimic the model selection we just performed using the qualitative “eyeball test,” but this time using a numerical and quantitative approach. Specifically, we’ll use the \\(R^2\\) summary statistic (pronounced “R-squared”), also called the “coefficient of determination.” But first, we must introduce one new concept: the variance of a numerical variable."

    "text": "2 R-squared (\\(R^2\\))\nWe’ve previously studied two summary statistics of the spread (or variation) of a numerical variable: the standard deviation and the interquartile range (IQR). We now introduce a third summary statistic of spread: the variance. The variance is merely the standard deviation squared and it can be computed in R using the var() summary function within summarize()1.\nLet’s investigate the variability of the SAT math scores, using the MA_schools dataset. In the first plot, we visualize the overall spread / variability in these scores, using a histogram. In the second plot, we investigate the relationship between SAT math scores and the percent of students who are economically disadvantaged.\nggplot(MA_schools, \n       aes(x = average_sat_math)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30) +\n  labs(x = \"Math SAT Score\")\nggplot(MA_schools, \n       aes(x = perc_disadvan, y = average_sat_math)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Percent economically disadvantaged\", y = \"Math SAT Score\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the variability of SAT math scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the variability of SAT math scores\n\n\n\n\n\nAs evidenced by the plot, there appears to be a moderately strong relationship between SAT math scores and the percent of students who are economically disadvantaged.

But what do these three terms tell us individually?\nFirst, the variance of \\(y\\) (denoted as \\(\\text{var}(y)\\)) tells us how much do Massachusetts high schools differ in average math SAT scores. The goal of regression modeling is to fit a model that hopefully explains this variation. In other words, we want to understand what factors explain why certain schools have high math SAT scores, while others have low scores. This is independent of the model; this is just data. In other words, whether we fit an interaction or parallel slopes model, \\(\\text{var}(y)\\) remains the same.\nSecond, the variance of \\(\\hat{y}\\) (denoted as \\(\\text{var}(\\hat{y})\\)) tells us how much the fitted values from our interaction model vary. That is to say, after accounting for (1) the percentage of the study body that is socioeconomically disadvantaged and (2) school size in an interaction model, how much do our model’s explanations of average math SAT scores vary?\nThird, the variance of the residuals tells us how much do “the left-overs” from the model vary. Observe how the points in the interaction plot above (on the left) scatter around the three lines. Say instead all the points fell exactly on one of the three lines. Then all residuals would be zero and hence the variance of the residuals would be zero.\nWe’re now ready to introduce \\(R^2\\)!\n\\[R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{var}(\\text{residuals})}{\\text{var}(y)}\\]\n\\(R^2\\) is the proportion of the spread / variation of the outcome variable \\(y\\) that is explained by our model, where our model’s explanatory power is embedded in the fitted values \\(\\hat{y}\\). Furthermore, since it can be mathematically proven that \\(0 \\leq \\text{var}(y) \\leq \\text{var}(\\hat{y})\\) (a fact we leave for an advanced class on regression), we are guaranteed that:\n\\[0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\]\nThus, \\(R^2\\) can be interpreted as follows:\n\n\\(R^2\\) values of 0 tell us that our model explains 0% of the variation in \\(y\\). Say we fit a model to the Massachusetts high school data and obtained \\(R^2 = 0\\). This would be telling us that the combination of explanatory variables (\\(x\\)) we used and model form we chose (interaction or parallel slopes) explains 0% of the variation in the SAT math scores. Or, in other words, the combination of explanatory variables (\\(x\\)) we used and model form we chose tell us nothing about average math SAT scores. The model is a poor fit.\n\\(R^2\\) values of 1 tell us that our model explains 100% of the variation in \\(y\\). Say we fit a model to the Massachusetts high school data and obtained \\(R^2 = 1\\). This would be telling us that the combination of explanatory variables (\\(x\\)) we used and model form we chose (interaction or parallel slopes) explains 100% of the variation in the SAT math scores. Or, in other words, the combination of explanatory variables (\\(x\\)) we used and model form we chose tell us everything we need to know about average math SAT scores.\n\nIn practice however, \\(R^2\\) values of 1 almost never occur. Think about it in the context of Massachusetts high schools. There are an infinite number of factors that influence why certain high schools perform well on SAT’s on average while others don’t perform well. The idea that a human-designed statistical model can capture all the heterogeneity of all high school students in Massachusetts is bordering on hubris. However, even if such models are not perfect, they may still prove useful in determining educational policy. A general principle of modeling we should keep in mind is a famous quote by eminent statistician George Box: “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”\n\n2.1 Model selection using R-squared\nWhen we learned about simple / basic regression, we discussed how, given a set of basic regressions, you could choose the “best” basic regression as the one where the explanatory variable has the strongest relationship with the response. We discussed this in terms of correlation, but for simple linear regression, \\(R^2\\) is the square of the correlation.\nThe ncbirths dataset contains a variety of variables on the habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. Suppose, we were interested in choosing a simple linear regression with the variable that has the strongest relationship with weight (the birth weight of the baby). For explanatory variables, we have:\n\nweeks – length of pregnancy\nmage – mother’s age\nvisits – number of hospital visits during pregnancy\ngained – weight gained during pregnancy\n\nLet’s explore each of these basic regression models!\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Comparison of four different simple regressions on birth weight of baby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncor\nvar_y\nvar_y_hat\nvar_residual\nr_sq\n\n\n\n\nWeeks\n0.6701013\n2.269123\n1.0188388\n1.250263\n0.4490106\n\n\nGained\n0.1541716\n2.222920\n0.0528386\n2.170076\n0.0237724\n\n\nVisits\n0.1348830\n2.214779\n0.0402781\n2.174549\n0.0181641\n\n\nMother's Age\n0.0550659\n2.276659\n0.0069004\n2.269741\n0.0030388\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 3, we can see that weeks has by far the strongest relationship with the birth weight of the baby, with a correlation of 0.670. Notice how we could get the \\(R^2\\) for this regression model (weight ~ weeks) two ways:\n\nWe could square the correlation: \\(0.670^2 =\\) 0.4489\nWe could find \\(1 - \\frac{\\text{var}(\\text{residuals})}{\\text{var}(y)} =\\) 0.4493392\n\nBoth methods produce an \\(R^2\\) of 0.4489. This value tells us that the simple linear regression with weeks as the explanatory variable is able to explain 44.9% of the variability in the birth weight of a baby.\n\n\n2.2 Adding more variables\nYou might say, well why not add more than one variable into the model. That makes sense, given what we’ve learned about multiple linear regression. However, when we have a regression with more than one explanatory variable, \\(R^2\\) is no longer a good summary measure of how much variability in the response we’ve explained with our model. The problem lies in the formula for \\(R^2\\)!\nThis strategy for estimating \\(R^2\\) is acceptable when there is just a single explanatory variable. However, it becomes less helpful when there are many variables. The regular \\(R^2\\) is a biased estimate of the amount of variability explained by the model when applied to model with more than one predictor. This is because any variable when added to the model will decrease the residuals, even just by a little bit.\nDecreasing the residuals leads to:\n\na smaller value of \\(\\text{var}(\\text{residuals})\\)\na smaller fraction of \\(\\frac{\\text{var}(\\text{residuals})}{\\text{var}(y)}\\)\na larger number of \\(1 - \\frac{\\text{var}(\\text{residuals})}{\\text{var}(y)}\\)\n\nThus, adding any variable will always result in a larger value of \\(R^2\\).\nFor example, I’ve added a new column to the ncbirths dataset, one that is entirely simulated noise and has no relationship with the birth weight of the baby. Here is a plot of my variable, just to confirm!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, now I’m including this noise variable as an explanatory variable in the multiple linear regression, where weeks is also an explanatory variable.\n\nnoise_lm &lt;- lm(weight ~ weeks + noise, data = ncbirths_noise)\n\nget_regression_points(noise_lm) |&gt; \n    summarize(var_y = var(weight), \n              var_y_hat = var(weight_hat), \n              var_residual = var(residual), \n              r_sq = 1 - (var_residual / var_y)\n              )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  var_y var_y_hat var_residual  r_sq\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2.27      1.02         1.25 0.450\n\n\nFrom the table above, we can see that the \\(R^2\\) value has increased. Not by much, but still! We went from an \\(R^2\\) of 0.449 when weeks was the only explanatory variable, to an \\(R^2\\) of 0.45 when noise was added as an explanatory variable. This may seem like a small change, but it may not necessarily always be small! Thus, this behavior was concerning to Statisticians, and they invented an alternative."

    "text": "3 Adjusted \\(R^2\\)\nTo get a better estimate, we use the adjusted \\(R^2\\)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-squared as a tool for model assessment.\n\n\n\nThe adjusted R-squared is computed as:\n\\[R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{var(residuals)} / (n - k - 1)}{\\text{var}(y) / (n - 1)}\\] \\[R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{var(residuals)}}{\\text{var}(y)} \\times \\frac{(n - 1)}{(n - k - 1)}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of observations used to fit the model and \\(k\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model. Remember that a categorical predictor with \\(p\\) levels will contribute \\(p - 1\\) to the number of variables in the model because we need \\(p - 1\\) offsets!\n\n\nBecause \\(k\\) is never negative, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) will be smaller – often times just a little smaller – than the unadjusted \\(R^2\\). The reasoning behind the adjusted \\(R^2\\) lies in the degrees of freedom associated with each variance, which is equal to \\(n - k - 1\\) in the multiple regression context. If we were to make predictions for new data using our current model, we would find that the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) would tend to be slightly overly optimistic, while the adjusted \\(R^2\\) formula helps correct this bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\) could also have been used instead of unadjusted \\(R^2\\) for basic regressions. However, when there is only \\(k = 1\\) explanatory variables, adjusted \\(R^2\\) is very close to regular \\(R^2\\), so this nuance isn’t typically important when the model has only one predictor.\n\n\nComing back to the multiple linear regression where I included a second noise variable, we can compare the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) to the adjusted \\(R^2\\). Rather than calculating all of these summary statistics “by hand”, we can use the get_regression_summaries() function to obtain interesting summary statistics about the model:\n\nget_regression_summaries(noise_lm)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Summary statistics from multiple linear regression with noise and weeks as predictor variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr_squared\nadj_r_squared\nmse\nrmse\n\n\n\n\n0.45\n0.449\n1.24702\n1.1167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice, Table 4 shows that adjusted \\(R^2\\) is lower than unadjusted \\(R^2\\). This is exactly what we want! We want our \\(R^2\\) to increase only if the extra variable we added was “worth it.” Here, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) suggests that adding a second explanatory variable (noise) is not worth the additional model complexity.\n\n3.1 Model selection using adjusted \\(R^2\\)\nAlright, let’s apply the concept of adjusted \\(R^2\\) to a multiple linear regression we are actually interested in. At the beginning of this reading, you were asked to recall the “eyeball” selection method we used to determine that the interaction model and parallel slopes model were unnecessarily more complicated than the simple linear regression model.\nIn Table 5 below, I’ve calculated the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for both the interaction model and parallel slopes model, and compared them to the simple linear regression model:\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Comparing R-squared values for three different models for SAT math scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr_squared\nadj_r_squared\nmse\nrmse\n\n\n\n\nInteraction Model\n0.699\n0.694\n1107.438\n33.27819\n\n\nParallel Slopes Model\n0.699\n0.696\n1108.609\n33.29578\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression Model\n0.696\n0.695\n1118.045\n33.43718\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values for the interaction model and parallel slopes model are nearly identical to the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) value from the simple linear regression model. These summaries suggest, there is no justification for added model complexity. The simple linear regression model with percent of students economically disadvantaged is able to explain the same amount of variance in the SAT math scores as the more complex models which include the size of the school.\n\nExtending to evals data\nNow let’s repeat this \\(R^2\\) comparison between interaction and parallel slopes model for our models of \\(y\\) = teaching score for UT Austin professors. In the ModernDive textbook, you visually compared using parallel slopes or different slopes to model the relationship between age and teaching score for male and female professors.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Comparing R-squared values from interaction and parallel slope models for UT Austin evaluation scores data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr_squared\nadj_r_squared\nmse\nrmse\n\n\n\n\nInteraction Model\n0.051\n0.045\n0.2799838\n0.5291350\n\n\nParallel Slopes Model\n0.039\n0.035\n0.2836345\n0.5325735\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values in Table 6 are now very different! The adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the interaction model is 0.045 (or 4.5%) and the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the parallel slopes model is 0.035 (or 3.5%). This may seem like a small change (of 1%), but if we calculate the percent change (\\(\\frac{0.045 - 0.035}{0.035}\\)), we see that by allowing the slopes to be different, we improved our adjusted \\(R^2\\) by almost 30%! Thus, it could be argued that the additional complexity is warranted."

    "title": "Week 6 – Model Selection",
    "section": "4 Step-wise Selection",
    "text": "4 Step-wise Selection\nAnother method for model selection is called “stepwise selection.” This method considers every possible explanatory variable in the dataset and decides if each variable should be included in the model, using a stepwise approach.\n\n4.1 Data Context\nFor our investigation of this method, we will consider data about loans from the peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club. The loan data includes terms of the loan as well as information about the borrower. The outcome variable we would like to better understand is the interest rate assigned to the loan. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, does it matter how much debt someone already has? Does it matter if their income has been verified? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.\nThe dataset includes results from 10,000 loans, and we’ll be looking at a subset of the available variables. The first six observations in the dataset are shown in Table 7 below, and descriptions for each variable are provided in Table 8. Notice that the past bankruptcy variable (bankruptcy) is an indicator variable, where it takes the value 1 if the borrower had a past bankruptcy in their record and 0 if not. Using an indicator variable in place of a category name allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. Two of the other variables are categorical (verified_income and issue_month), each of which can take one of a few different non-numerical values.\n\nThe loans_full_schema data can be found in the openintro R package. Based on the data in this dataset we have created two new variables: credit_util which is calculated as the total credit utilized divided by the total credit limit and bankruptcy which turns the number of bankruptcies to an indicator variable (0 for no bankruptcies and 1 for at least 1 bankruptcy). We will refer to this modified dataset as loans.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: First six rows of the loans dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterest_rate\nverified_income\ndebt_to_income\ncredit_util\nbankruptcy\nterm\ncredit_checks\nissue_month\n\n\n\n\n14.07\nVerified\n18.01\n0.5475952\n0\n60\n6\nMar-2018\n\n\n12.61\nNot Verified\n5.04\n0.1500347\n1\n36\n1\nFeb-2018\n\n\n17.09\nSource Verified\n21.15\n0.6613483\n0\n36\n4\nFeb-2018\n\n\n6.72\nNot Verified\n10.16\n0.1967323\n0\n36\n0\nJan-2018\n\n\n14.07\nVerified\n57.96\n0.7549077\n0\n36\n7\nMar-2018\n\n\n6.72\nNot Verified\n6.46\n0.0925891\n0\n36\n6\nJan-2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Variables and their descriptions for the loans dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninterest_rate\nInterest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage.\n\n\nverified_income\nCategorical variable describing whether the borrower's income source and amount have been verified, with levels `Verified`, `Source Verified`, and `Not Verified`.\n\n\ndebt_to_income\nDebt-to-income ratio, which is the percentage of total debt of the borrower divided by their total income.\n\n\ncredit_util\nOf all the credit available to the borrower, what fraction are they utilizing. For example, the credit utilization on a credit card would be the card's balance divided by the card's credit limit.\n\n\nbankruptcy\nAn indicator variable for whether the borrower has a past bankruptcy in their record.

For example, when filing an application for a credit card, it is common for the company receiving the application to run a credit check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Stepwise selection\nTwo common strategies for adding or removing variables in a multiple regression model are called backward elimination and forward selection. These techniques are often referred to as stepwise selection strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they “step” through the candidate predictors.\nBackward elimination starts with the full model (the model that includes every potential predictor variable). Variables are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until we cannot improve the model any further.\nForward selection is the reverse of the backward elimination technique. Instead, of eliminating variables one-at-a-time, we add variables one-at-a-time until we cannot find any variables that improve the model any further.\nAn important consideration in implementing either of these stepwise selection strategies is the criterion used to decide whether to eliminate or add a variable. One commonly used decision criterion is adjusted \\(R^2\\). When using adjusted \\(R^2\\) as the decision criterion, we seek to eliminate or add variables depending on whether they lead to the largest improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\) and we stop when adding or elimination of another variable does not lead to further improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\).\n\nBackward Selection\nLet’s consider two models, which are shown in Table 9 and Table 10 below. The first table summarizes the full model since it includes all predictors, while the second does not include the issue_month variable.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: The fit for the full regression model, including the adjusted R-squared.\n\n\n\n\nThe fit for the full regression model, including the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.89\n0.21\n9.01\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeSource Verified\n1.00\n0.10\n10.06\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeVerified\n2.56\n0.12\n21.87\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndebt_to_income\n0.02\n0.00\n7.43\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_util\n4.90\n0.16\n30.25\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbankruptcy1\n0.39\n0.13\n2.96\n0.0031\n\n\nterm\n0.15\n0.00\n38.89\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_checks\n0.23\n0.02\n12.52\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nissue_monthJan-2018\n0.05\n0.11\n0.42\n0.6736\n\n\nissue_monthMar-2018\n-0.04\n0.11\n-0.39\n0.696\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.2597\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ndf = 9964\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: he fit for the regression model after dropping issue month, including the adjusted R-squared.\n\n\n\n\nThe fit for the regression model after dropping issue month, including the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.90\n0.20\n9.56\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeSource Verified\n1.00\n0.10\n10.05\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeVerified\n2.56\n0.12\n21.86\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndebt_to_income\n0.02\n0.00\n7.44\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_util\n4.90\n0.16\n30.25\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbankruptcy1\n0.39\n0.13\n2.96\n0.0031\n\n\nterm\n0.15\n0.00\n38.89\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_checks\n0.23\n0.02\n12.52\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.2598\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ndf = 9966\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhich of the two models is better?\nWe compare the adjusted \\(R^2\\) of each model to determine which to choose. Since the second model has a higher \\(R^2_{adj}\\) compared to the first model, we prefer the second model to the first.\n\n\nWill the model without issue_month be better than the model with issue_month? We cannot know for sure, but based on the adjusted \\(R^2\\), this is our best assessment.\nResults corresponding to the full model for the loans data are shown in Table 9. How should we proceed under the backward elimination strategy?\nOur baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) from the full model is 0.2597, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted \\(R^2\\). To check, we fit models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for each model:\n\nExcluding verified_income: 0.2238\nExcluding debt_to_income: 0.2557\nExcluding credit_util: 0.1916\nExcluding bankruptcy: 0.2589\nExcluding term: 0.1468\nExcluding credit_checks: 0.2484\nExcluding issue_month: 0.2598\n\nThe model without issue_month has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.2598, higher than the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the full model. Because eliminating issue_month leads to a model with a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\), we drop issue_month from the model.\nSince we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors. Our baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) is now \\(R^2_{adj} = 0.2598\\) – the adjusted \\(R^2\\) from the model without issue_month. We now fit new models, which consider eliminating issue_month and each of the remaining predictors:\n\nExcluding issue_month and verified_income: 0.22395\nExcluding issue_month and debt_to_income: 0.25579\nExcluding issue_month and credit_util: 0.19174\nExcluding issue_month and bankruptcy: 0.25898\nExcluding issue_month and term: 0.14692\nExcluding issue_month and credit_checks: 0.24801\n\nNone of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\), so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors. That is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps all predictors except issue_month, which we can summarize using the coefficients from Table 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward Selection\nNext, let’s use forward selection to construct a model for predicting interest_rate from the loans data.\nWe start with the model that includes no predictors. Then we fit each of the possible models with just one predictor. Then we examine the \\(R^2\\) for each of these models3:\n\nIncluding verified_income: 0.05926\nIncluding debt_to_income: 0.01946\nIncluding credit_util: 0.06452\nIncluding bankruptcy: 0.00222\nIncluding term: 0.12855\nIncluding credit_checks: -0.0001\nIncluding issue_month: 0.01711\n\nIn this first step, we compare the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) against a baseline model that has no predictors. The no-predictors model always has \\(R^2 = 0\\). The model with one predictor that has the largest \\(R^2\\) is the model with the term predictor, and because this \\(R^2\\) is larger than the \\(R^2\\) from the model with no predictors (\\(R^2 = 0\\)), we will add this variable to our model.\nWe repeat the process again, this time considering the adjusted \\(R^2\\)4 for all 2-predictor models where one of the predictors is term and with a new baseline of \\(R^2 = 0.12855:\\)\n\nIncluding term and verified_income: 0.16851\nIncluding term and debt_to_income: 0.14368\nIncluding term and credit_util: 0.20046\nIncluding term and bankruptcy: 0.13070\nIncluding term and credit_checks: 0.12840\nIncluding term and issue_month: 0.14294\n\nAdding credit_util yields the highest increase in adjusted \\(R^2\\) and has a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) (0.20046) than the baseline (0.12855). Thus, we will also add credit_util to the model as a predictor.\nSince we have again added a predictor to the model, we again have a new baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.20046. We can continue on and see whether it would be beneficial to add a third predictor:\n\nIncluding term, credit_util, and verified_income: 0.24183\nIncluding term, credit_util, and debt_to_income: 0.20810\nIncluding term, credit_util, and bankruptcy: 0.20169\nIncluding term, credit_util, and credit_checks: 0.20031\nIncluding term, credit_util, and issue_month: 0.21629\n\nThe model including verified_income has the largest increase in adjusted \\(R^2\\) (0.24183) from the baseline (0.20046), so we add verified_income to the model as a predictor as well.\nWe continue on in this way, next adding debt_to_income, then credit_checks, and bankruptcy. At this point, we come again to the issue_month variable: adding this as a predictor leads to \\(R_{adj}^2 = 0.25843\\), while keeping all the other predictors but excluding issue_month has a higher \\(R_{adj}^2 = 0.25854\\). This means we do not add issue_month to the model as a predictor. In this example, we have arrived at the same model that we identified from backward elimination.\n\n\n\n4.3 A recap\nBackward elimination begins with the model having the largest number of predictors and eliminates variables one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining variables are important to the model. Forward selection starts with no variables included in the model, then it adds in variables according to their importance until no other important variables are found. Notice that, for both methods, we have always chosen to retain the model with the largest adjusted \\(R^2\\) value, even if the difference is less than half a percent (e.g., 0.2597 versus 0.2598). One could argue that the difference between these two models is negligible, as they both explain nearly the same amount of variability in the interest_rate. These negligible differences are an important aspect to model selection. It is highly advised that before you begin the model selection process, you decide what a “meaningful” difference in adjusted \\(R^2\\) is for the context of your data. Maybe this difference is 1% or maybe it is 5%. This “threshold” is what you will then use to decide if one model is “better” than another model. Using meaningful thresholds in model selection requires more critical thinking about what the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values mean.\nAdditionally, backward elimination and forward selection sometimes arrive at different final models. This is because the decision for whether to include a given variable or not depends on the other variables that are already in the model. With forward selection, you start with a model that includes no variables and add variables one at a time. In backward elimination, you start with a model that includes all of the variables and remove variables one at a time. How much a given variable changes the percentage of the variability in the outcome that is explained by the model depends on what other variables are in the model. This is especially important if the predictor variables are correlated with each other.\nThere is no “one size fits all” model selection strategy, which is why there are so many different model selection methods. We hope you walk away from this exploration understanding how stepwise selection is carried out and the considerations that should be made when using stepwise selection with regression models."

Stepwise selection can also be carried out with decision criteria other than adjusted \\(R^2\\), such as p-values, which you’ll learn about in later weeks, or AIC (Akaike information criterion) or BIC (Bayesian information criterion), which you might learn about in more advanced statistics courses or your disciplinary courses.\nAlternatively, one could choose to include or exclude variables from a model based on expert opinion or due to research focus. In fact, many statisticians discourage the use of stepwise regression alone for model selection and advocate, instead, for a more thoughtful approach that carefully considers the research focus and features of the data."

    "text": "1.2 Simulation-based Methods (Permutation Distribution)\nFor this question, I am interested in testing if the relationship between body mass and bill length (slope) is different for male versus female penguins. If I were to write my hypotheses down, they would be:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same regardless of their sex\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is different for male and female penguins\n\nUsing Cards\nWhen generating new datasets that could have happened if the null hypothesis was true, it helps me to think about what actions I am taking with my dataset. As you’ve seen before, I like to think about this using cards.\n\nSuppose I have 333 cards, one card per penguin.\n\nOn each card, I write the penguin’s (bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex).\n\nIf I think the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same regardless of the penguin’s sex (the null hypothesis), then I tear the sex label off each card.\n\nThis leaves me with 333 cards with (bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) measurements and 333 cards with different sex labels. Technically, I would have 165 cards saying female and 168 cards saying male.\n\nI would then randomly draw one card from the (bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) pile and one card from the sex pile and staple them together.\n\nI would continue this process until every (bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) card had a new value for sex.\n\n\nMy resulting dataset would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nshuffled_sex\n\n\n\n\n36.5\n2850\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n46.4\n4700\nfemale\nfemale\n\n\n37.6\n3750\nmale\nfemale\n\n\n39.0\n3050\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n42.8\n4700\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n52.7\n3725\nmale\nfemale\n\n\n36.6\n3475\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n50.7\n4050\nmale\nmale\n\n\n46.0\n4150\nfemale\nfemale\n\n\n43.5\n4650\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can visualize the relationship between body mass and bill length for our shuffled dataset. Notice how the slopes for male and female penguins in the plot below are much more similar than the original plot? Why do you think that is? It’s because we assumed these relationships were the same (the null hypothesis) when we generated this permuted dataset!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslating into the infer pipeline\nTo generate lots of these permuted datasets, we are going to use the infer package. The process for using these tools for a multiple linear regression are similar, but slightly different from what you saw with a simple linear regression. Namely, we specify() our model in a slightly different way, and we use the fit() function instead of the calculate() function.\n\n\nStep 1: Fitting our Model\nSimilar to a basic regression, in our first step we need to obtain our observed statistic. To do this, we specify() the model we are interested in, and then tell infer to fit() this model. The code below does exactly that!\n\nobserved_fit &lt;- penguins_clean %&gt;%\n  specify(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g * sex) %&gt;%\n  fit()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Your Model\n\n\n\nWhen we have multiple explanatory variables, we need to use the “tilde” (~) syntax to specify our model. Keep in mind, we are interested in a different slopes multiple regression, so we are using a * to separate our two explanatory variables. If we were interested in a parallel slopes regression, we would us a + instead!\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Finding our Observed Statistic\nNow that we’ve fit our model, we need to figure out which of these coefficients is our observed statistic. Which do you think it is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n25.571381438\n\n\nbody_mass_g\n0.004278721\n\n\nsexmale\n5.516061110\n\n\nbody_mass_g:sexmale\n-0.001030075\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we’re interested in how the slope between body mass and bill length differs between male and female penguins, our statistic is associated with the body_mass_g:sexmale row of this table.\n\n\nStep 3: Generating Permuted Fits\nNow that we have our observed statistic, we need to generate datasets that could have happened if the null hypothesis was true. Similar to basic regression, we obtain these permuted datasets by adding two steps:\n\nwe tell infer our hypothesise() – the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and bill length is \"independent\" of its sex\nwe stipulate how many of these new datasets we want (reps) and the method infer should use when generating these datasets (\"permute\")\n\n\nnull_fits &lt;- penguins_clean %&gt;%\n  specify(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g * sex) %&gt;%\n  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") %&gt;% \n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %&gt;%\n  fit()\n\n\n\nStep 4: Visualizing our Null Distribution\nWe’ve used the visualize() function before, to obtain a histogram of our permuted statistics. With a multiple linear regression, the visualize() function generates a histogram for every coefficient. Since we are only interested in the body_mass_g:sexmale coefficient, I’ve pulled that one out:\n\nobs_offset &lt;- observed_fit %&gt;% \n  filter(term == \"body_mass_g:sexmale\") %&gt;% \n  pull(estimate)\n\nnull_fits %&gt;% \n  filter(term == \"body_mass_g:sexmale\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = estimate)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 0.0005) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_offset, color = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, our null distribution is centered at 0. In this context, 0 represents the offset when going from female penguins to male penguins, meaning the relationship between bill length and body mass does not change when going from female penguins (the baseline group) to male penguins.\nOur observed statistic (-0.0010301) is noted in red. The statistic falls somewhat on the edge of the distribution, but not far into the tail. This location suggests our observed statistic could happen somewhat frequently if the null hypothesis was true.\n\n\nStep 4: Calculating our p-value\nOur final coding step is to calculate our p-value. To do this, we need three pieces of information:\n\nstatistics that would have happened if the null was true\nour observed statistic\nthe direction(s) that should be used when calculating the p-value\n\nThe direction of the hypothesis test is determined by the alternative hypothesis. For our research question, we are testing if there is a difference in the relationship between bill length and body mass, which aligns with a \"two-sided\" alternative hypothesis.\n\nget_p_value(null_fits,\n            obs_stat = observed_fit,\n            direction = \"two-sided\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\np_value\n\n\n\n\nbody_mass_g\n0.000\n\n\nbody_mass_g:sexmale\n0.220\n\n\nintercept\n0.000\n\n\nsexmale\n0.116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, our statistic of interest is body_mass_g:sexmale. The p-value for this statistic is 0.22, telling us that 220 permuted statistics (out of 1,000) were as large or larger than what we observed in our data.\n\n\nStep 5: Make a Decision & Reaching a Conclusion\nFor an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.1 (or 0.05 or 0.01), we would decide to fail to reject the null hypothesis (that he relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same regardless of their sex).\nTherefore, our data provided insufficient evidence that the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length differs based on the sex of the penguin."

These conditions are:\n\nLinear relationship between our explanatory and response variable\nIndependence of observations\nNormality of residuals\nEqual variance of residuals\n\nBased on what we saw in Figure 1, it appears that there is a moderate linear relationship between body mass and bill length. From the description of how the data were collected (LTER and Gorman 2020), it doesn’t seem like the same penguin could be captured multiple times. I also know that a penguin could only belong to one of these two groups (male, female). However, it is possible penguins who were captured could be genetically related (from the same family), so there could be possible relationships between the observations.\nConditions three and four involve the residuals of the regression model, visualized in the two plots below. In Figure 2 (a) we see that the distribution of residuals is unimodal and fairly symmetric. While it does appear that there is a slight right skew, I am not super concerned as there are very few observations in the right tail. In Figure 2 (b) we see that the vertical spread of the residuals (on the y-axis) appears similar across the fitted / predicted values of bill length, with most of the residuals falling between +10 and -10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Scatterplot of residuals versus fitted / predicted values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figures\n\n\n\nAs I did not find that any of these conditions were violated, it seems reasonable to use the \\(t\\)-distribution as an approximation for the permutation distribution.\n\nUsing the \\(t\\)-distribution\nIf you continue along in your R adventures, you will find that the majority of functions built-in to R use parametric / theory-based methods to obtain p-values and confidence intervals.

Looking at the row of the regression table associated with body_mass_g:sexmale, we first see two things we’ve seen before (1) our observed statistic of -0.0010301, and (2) an estimate of the variability of that statistic (standard error). The next two columns are new!\nThe statistic column represents the value of the \\(t\\)-statistic. This statistic is calculated as \\(\\frac{\\text{estimate}}{\\text{SE of the estimate}}\\). In general, you can think of a \\(t\\)-statistic as a way to standardize how “surprising” an estimate is, if the null hypothesis was true. In most cases, values larger than 2 are thought to indicate statistics that would be very “unusual” if the null hypothesis was true.\nFinally, the p_value column finds where the \\(4\\)-statistic falls on the \\(t\\)-distribution and calculates its resulting p-value. By default, the p-value is calculated using both sides (similar to using \"two-sided\" before). The \\(t\\)-distribution returns a p-value of 0.126. While this p-value leads to a similar decision and conclusion as the p-value we obtained from the permutation distribution, it is about 0.1 lower than our previous p-value. Why do you think that is?"

Last time we had one line that we were interested in (body_mass_g:sexmale), but now we have two lines. What gives?\n\n\nMultiple Hypothesis Tests\nTechnically, each of these lines is testing if that group has a different slope than the baseline group. Meaning, the body_mass_g:speciesChinstrap line is running the following hypothesis test:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is different for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins\nSimilarly, the body_mass_g:speciesGentoo line is testing:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same for Adelie and Gentoo penguins\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is different for Adelie and Gentoo penguins\nThis doesn’t quite seem like what I want. I want to test if all of the species have the same relationship!\n\n\nTesting 3+ Groups\nWhen I’m in the scenario where I have three or more groups, a \\(t\\)-distribution isn’t the best tool for the job since it only allows us to test each group relative to the baseline. An ANOVA (analysis of variance), however, can test for differences among three or more groups!\nIf you’ve never encountered an ANOVA before, it has a large number of similarities to what we saw with the \\(t\\)-distribution. There are, however, two main differences. First, an ANOVA has slightly different hypotheses. Since we have three or more groups, our hypotheses are no longer in terms of comparing one group with another. Instead, our hypotheses test for similarities / differences among all of the groups. Specifically, we have the following hypotheses:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is the same regardless of their species\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is different for at least one species\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Negation\n\n\n\nAn alternative hypothesis is always the negation of the null hypothesis. In an ANOVA, the null hypothesis says “every group is the same.” The negation of “every group is the same” is not “every group is different.” The negation of “every group is the same” is “at least one group is different.”\n\n\n\n\nANOVA\nTo carry out an ANOVA, we use the anova() function in R. The output of the anova() function is messy, so I’m piping the result into the tidy() function (from the broom package) to clean it up a bit!\n\nanova(species_lm) %&gt;% \n  tidy()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nbody_mass_g\n1\n3449.82317\n3449.823171\n591.920719\n0.0000000\n\n\nspecies\n2\n4553.33934\n2276.669668\n390.631021\n0.0000000\n\n\nbody_mass_g:species\n2\n19.92386\n9.961928\n1.709268\n0.1826114\n\n\nResiduals\n327\n1905.81634\n5.828185\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the ANOVA table, we are interested in the body_mass_g:species line. Specifically, we are interested in the statistic and p.value columns. We will learn more about the statistic column when we dive deeper into ANOVA next week, so for right now know that it is a measure of how much additional variation in bill length is being explained by having different slopes for each species.\nBased on the p.value column, it doesn’t seem like there is evidence that the relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length is different for at least one species."

    "text": "1.5 How do body mass and flipper length influence a penguin’s bill length?\nOur multiple linear regressions take take on a variety of flavors, including models with multiple numerical explanatory variables. An example of this type of model is adding flipper length as a second explanatory variable (in addition to body mass) when explaining the length of a penguin’s bill. This type of investigation is similar to what many of you did for your Midterm Project, where you decided if there was evidence that both explanatory variables have a relationship with the response.\nBased on the scatterplot below, it does seem that both body mass and flipper length have a relationship with a penguin’s bill length.

Finally, Figure 7 (b) suggests the variance in the residuals is fairly similar across the predicted bill lengths, going from about -10 to +10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Scatterplot of residuals versus fitted / predicted values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Figures\n\n\n\nAs I did not find that any of these conditions were violated, it seems reasonable to use theory-based methods as an approximation for the permutation distribution.\n\n\nObtaining our p-value\nUnfortunately, when testing for a relationship between each explanatory variable and the response, the get_regression_table() function does not do what we want. What we want is for the p-value for each variable to be conditional on the other variable(s) in the model, but the p-values for variables output from get_regression_table() are tested in the order they are listed. Meaning, if body_mass_g is the first variable listed in the model, then the p-value output is not conditional on flipper_length_mm also being included in the model.\nBut we have a tool that will give us what we want! An ANOVA!!!\n\n\nMultiple Hypothesis Tests\n\nmlr_anova &lt;- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + flipper_length_mm, \n                   data = penguins_clean)\n\nanova(mlr_lm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nbody_mass_g\n1\n3449.8232\n3449.82317\n200.48905\n0\n\n\nflipper_length_mm\n1\n800.7561\n800.75612\n46.53654\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n330\n5678.3234\n17.20704\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, each of these lines is testing if there is a relationship between the explanatory variable and the response, controlling for the other variable(s) in the model. Meaning, the flipper_length_mm line is running the following hypothesis test:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, controlling for a penguin’s body mass there is no relationship between a penguin’s flipper length and their bill length\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, controlling for a penguin’s body mass there is a relationship between a penguin’s flipper length and their bill length\nSimilarly, the body_mass_g line is testing:\n\\(H_0\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, controlling for a penguin’s flipper length there is no relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length\n\\(H_A\\): For penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, controlling for a penguin’s flipper length there is a relationship between a penguin’s body mass and their bill length\nGiven the p-values output from the table, it appears that after controlling for a penguin’s flipper length, there is a relationship between a penguin’s body mass and bill length (p-value &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, there is also evidence that (after controlling for a penguin’s body mass) there is a relationship between the length of a penguin’s flipper and its bill length (p-value &lt; 0.0001)."

    "text": "In this week’s coursework we are finally talking about p-values! What we learned last week should have helped make the connection between a sampling distribution and a bootstrap (resampling) distribution. Hopefully, you understand that we create confidence intervals based the statistics we saw in other samples.\nThis week we are going to connect these ideas to the framework of hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing requires an additional component we didn’t see last week—the null hypothesis. We will learn how we integrate the null hypothesis in our resampling procedure to create a sampling distribution that could have happened if the null hypothesis was true. We will use this distribution to compare what we saw in our data and evaluate the plausibility of competing hypotheses.\nThis reading will walk you through the general framework for understanding hypothesis tests. By understanding this general framework, you’ll be able to adapt it to many different scenarios. The same can be said for confidence intervals. There was one general framework that applies to all confidence intervals. I believe this focus on the conceptual framework is better for long-term learning than focusing on specific details for specific instances."

    "text": "1.3 Simulating data\nFirst, try to imagine a hypothetical universe where there is no relationship between the birth weight of a baby and a mother’s age. In such a hypothetical universe, the birth weight of a baby would be entirely determined from other variables (e.g., genetics, mother’s habits, etc.)\nBringing things back to the births14 data frame, the mage variable would thus be an irrelevant label, as is has no relationship with the birth weight of the baby. Since is has no bearing on the birth weight, we could randomly reassign these ages by “shuffling” them!\nTo illustrate this idea, let’s narrow our focus to six arbitrarily chosen birth records (of the 1,000) Table 2. The weight column displays the birth weight of the baby. The mage column displays the age of the mother. However, in our hypothesized universe there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age, so it would be of no consequence to randomly “shuffle” the values of mage. The shuffled_mage column shows one such possible random shuffling.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: One example of shuffling mage variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nweight\nmage\nshuffled_mage\n\n\n\n\n726\n8.75\n18\n26\n\n\n602\n8.53\n32\n22\n\n\n326\n6.81\n28\n24\n\n\n79\n7.01\n22\n18\n\n\n974\n6.03\n24\n32\n\n\n884\n6.32\n26\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, such random shuffling of the mage label only makes sense in our hypothesized universe where there is no relationship between the birth weight of a baby and a mother’s age. How could we extend this shuffling of the mage variable to all 1,000 birth records by hand?\nOne way would be writing the 1,000 weights and mages on a set of 1,000 cards. We would then rip each card in half, as we are assuming there is no relationship between these variables. We would then be left with 1,000 weight cards in one hat and 1,000 mage cards in a different hat. You could then draw one card out of the weight hat and one card out of the mage hat and staple them together to make a new (weight, mage) ordered pair. This process of drawing one card out of each hat and stapling them together would be repeated until we had paired each mage card with a new weight card.\nI’ve done one such reshuffling and plotted the original dataset and the shuffled dataset side-by-side in Figure 2. It appears that the slope of the regression line for the shuffled data is much less steep (closer to horizontal) than in the original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original values of mother’s age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Shuffled values of mother’s age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplots of relationship between baby’s birth weight and mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare these slope estimates between the two datasets:\n\nshuffled_births14 %&gt;% \n  specify(response = weight, explanatory = mage) %&gt;% \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nResponse: weight (numeric)\nExplanatory: mage (numeric)\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    stat\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0142\n\n\nSo, in this hypothetical universe where there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age, we obtained a slope of 0.014.\nNotice that this slope statistic is not the same as the slope statistic of 0.014 that we originally observed. This is once again due to sampling variation. How can we better understand the effect of this sampling variation? By repeating this shuffling several times!"

A slope of 0 means there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and mother’s age, which is exactly what our hypothetical universe assumes!\nHowever, while the values are centered at 0, there is variation about 0. This is because even in a hypothesized universe of no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and mother’s age, you will still likely observe a slight relationship because of chance sampling variation. Looking at the histogram in Figure 3, such differences could even be as extreme as 0.02.\nTurning our attention to what we observed in the births14 dataset: the observed slope of 0.014 is is marked with a vertical dark line. Ask yourself: in a hypothesized world of no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and mother’s age, how likely would it be that we observe this slope statistic? That’s hard to say! It looks like there is only one statistic larger than the observed statistic out of ten, but that means we would expect to see a statistic bigger than what we saw 10% of the time in this hypothetical universe. To me, something happening 10% of the time doesn’t seem like a rare event."

The term ““permutation” is the mathematical term for “shuffling”: taking a series of values and reordering them randomly, as you did with the mage values.\nIn fact, permutations are another form of resampling, like the bootstrap method you performed last week. While the bootstrap method involves resampling with replacement, permutation methods involve resampling without replacement.\nThink back to the exercise involving the slips of paper representing the 1,000 birth records from last week. After sampling a paper, you put the paper back into the hat. However, in this scenario, once we drew a weight and age card they were stapled together and never redrawn.\nIn our example, we saw that the observed slope in the births14 dataset was somewhat inconsistent with the hypothetical universe, but only slightly. Thus, I would not be inclined to say that the observed relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age (seen in the births14 dataset) is that different from what I would expect to see if there was no relationship between these variables."

Instead of merely adding a vertical line using geom_vline(), let’s use the shade_p_value() function with obs_stat set to the observed test statistic (observed slope statistic) value we saved in obs_slope.\nFurthermore, we’ll set the direction = \"two-sided\" reflecting our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\), stating that there is a relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age. As stated in Section 2, a two-sided hypothesis test does not make any assumptions about the direction of the relationship, meaning \\(\\beta_1 &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\beta_1 &gt; 0\\) are equally plausible. So, when calculating statistics that are “more extreme” than what we observed, we need to look in both tails.\n\nvisualize(null_distribution, bins = 10) + \n  labs(x = \"Permuted (Shuffled) Slope Statistic\") +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_slope, direction = \"two-sided\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Shaded histogram to show \\(p\\)-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resulting Figure 8, the solid dark line marks 0.014. However, what does the shaded-region correspond to? This is the \\(p\\)-value. Recall the definition of the \\(p\\)-value from Section 2:\n\nA \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.\n\nSo judging by the shaded region in Figure 8, it seems we would somewhat rarely observe a slope statistic of 0.014 or more extreme in a hypothesized universe where there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age. In other words, the \\(p\\)-value is somewhat small. Hence, we might be inclined to reject this hypothesized universe, or using statistical language we would “reject \\(H_0\\).”\nWhat fraction of the null distribution is shaded? In other words, what is the exact value of the \\(p\\)-value? We can compute it using the get_p_value() function with the same arguments as the previous shade_p_value() code:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   0.054\n\n\nKeeping the definition of a \\(p\\)-value in mind, the probability of observing a slope statistic as large as 0.014 or something more extreme due to sampling variation alone in the null distribution is 0.054 = 5.4%. Since this \\(p\\)-value is larger than our pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\). In other words, this \\(p\\)-value is not small enough to reject our hypothesized universe where there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age. Notice how our interpretation of this p-value does not state that we accept the null hypothesis. Rather, we have insufficient evidence to reject it. I will discuss these differences more in Section 4.1.\nObserve that whether we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or not depends in large part on our choice of significance level \\(\\alpha\\), as if we had chosen an \\(\\alpha\\) of 0.1, we would have had sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We’ll discuss this more in Section 4.2."

    "text": "4.1 Two possible outcomes\nIn Section 2, we mentioned that given a pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) there are two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test:\n\nIf the \\(p\\)-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), then we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\).\nIf the \\(p\\)-value is greater than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).\n\nUnfortunately, the latter result is often misinterpreted as “accepting the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).” While at first glance it may seem that the statements “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent, there actually is a subtle difference. Saying that we “accept the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to stating that “we think the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.” However, saying that we “fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is saying something else: “While \\(H_0\\) might still be false, we don’t have enough evidence to say so.” In other words, there is an absence of enough proof. However, the absence of proof is not proof of absence. 🧐\nTo further shed light on this distinction, let’s use the United States criminal justice system as an analogy. A criminal trial in the United States is a similar situation to hypothesis tests whereby a choice between two contradictory claims must be made about a defendant who is on trial:\n\nThe defendant is truly either “innocent” or “guilty.”\nThe defendant is presumed “innocent until proven guilty.”\nThe defendant is found guilty only if there is strong evidence that the defendant is guilty. The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is often used as a guideline for determining a cutoff for when enough evidence exists to find the defendant guilty.\nThe defendant is found to be either “not guilty” or “guilty” in the ultimate verdict.\n\nIn other words, not guilty verdicts are not suggesting the defendant is innocent, but instead that “while the defendant may still actually be guilty, there wasn’t enough evidence to prove this fact.” Now let’s make the connection with hypothesis tests:\n\nEither the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is true.\nHypothesis tests are conducted assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.\nWe reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\) only if the evidence found in the sample suggests that \\(H_A\\) is true. The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is used as a guideline to set the threshold on just how strong of evidence we require.\nWe ultimately decide to either “fail to reject \\(H_0\\)” or “reject \\(H_0\\).”\n\nSo while gut instinct may suggest “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent statements, they are not. “Accepting \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to finding a defendant innocent. However, courts do not find defendants “innocent,” but rather they find them “not guilty.” Putting things differently, defense attorneys do not need to prove that their clients are innocent, rather they only need to prove that clients are not “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt”.\nSo going back to the births14 dataset, recall that our hypothesis test was \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\) and that we used a pre-specified significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05. We found a \\(p\\)-value of 0.054. Since the \\(p\\)-value was smaller than \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, we rejected \\(H_0\\). In other words, we found needed levels of evidence in this particular sample to say that \\(H_0\\) is false at the \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 significance level. We also state this conclusion using non-statistical language: we found enough evidence in this data to suggest that there was gender discrimination at play."

    "text": "4.2 Types of errors\nUnfortunately, there is some chance a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict. For example, finding a truly innocent defendant “guilty”. Or on the other hand, finding a truly guilty defendant “not guilty.” This can often stem from the fact that prosecutors don’t have access to all the relevant evidence, but instead are limited to whatever evidence the police can find.\nThe same holds for hypothesis tests. We can make incorrect decisions about a population parameter because we only have a sample of data from the population and thus sampling variation can lead us to incorrect conclusions.\nThere are two possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial: either (1) a truly innocent person is found guilty or (2) a truly guilty person is found not guilty. Similarly, there are two possible errors in a hypothesis test: either (1) rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true, called a Type I error or (2) failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false, called a Type II error. Another term used for “Type I error” is “false positive,” while another term for “Type II error” is “false negative.”\nThis risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing inference on a sample instead of performing a census on the entire population. But as we’ve seen in our numerous examples and activities so far, censuses are often very expensive and other times impossible, and thus researchers have no choice but to use a sample. Thus in any hypothesis test based on a sample, we have no choice but to tolerate some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur.\nTo help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II errors, we apply these terms to our criminal justice analogy in Figure 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Type I and Type II errors in criminal trials.\n\n\n\nThus a Type I error corresponds to incorrectly putting a truly innocent person in jail, whereas a Type II error corresponds to letting a truly guilty person go free. Let’s show the corresponding table in Figure 10 for hypothesis tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis tests."

    "text": "4.3 How do we choose alpha?\nIf we are using a sample to make inferences about a population, we run the risk of making errors. For confidence intervals, a corresponding “error” would be constructing a confidence interval that does not contain the true value of the population parameter. For hypothesis tests, this would be making either a Type I or Type II error. Obviously, we want to minimize the probability of either error; we want a small probability of making an incorrect conclusion:\n\nThe probability of a Type I Error occurring is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\). The value of \\(\\alpha\\) is called the significance level of the hypothesis test, which we defined in Section 2.\nThe probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\). The value of \\(1-\\beta\\) is known as the power of the hypothesis test.\n\nIn other words, \\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to the probability of incorrectly rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true. On the other hand, \\(\\beta\\) corresponds to the probability of incorrectly failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false.\nIdeally, we want \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\), meaning that the chance of making either error is 0. However, this can never be the case in any situation where we are sampling for inference. There will always be the possibility of making either error when we use sample data. Furthermore, these two error probabilities are inversely related. As the probability of a Type I error goes down, the probability of a Type II error goes up.\nWhat is typically done in practice is to fix the probability of a Type I error by pre-specifying a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and then try to minimize \\(\\beta\\). In other words, we will tolerate a certain fraction of incorrect rejections of the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), and then try to minimize the fraction of incorrect non-rejections of \\(H_0\\).\nSo for example if we used \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01, we would be using a hypothesis testing procedure that in the long run would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) one percent of the time. This is analogous to setting the confidence level of a confidence interval.\nSo what value should you use for \\(\\alpha\\)? Different fields have different conventions, but some commonly used values include 0.10, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. However, it is important to keep in mind that if you use a relatively small value of \\(\\alpha\\), then all things being equal, \\(p\\)-values will have a harder time being less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus we would reject the null hypothesis less often. In other words, we would reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) only if we have very strong evidence to do so. This is known as a “conservative” test.\nOn the other hand, if we used a relatively large value of \\(\\alpha\\), then all things being equal, \\(p\\)-values will have an easier time being less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus we would reject the null hypothesis more often. In other words, we would reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) even if we only have mild evidence to do so. This is known as a “liberal” test."

    "text": "6.1 Interpreting regression tables\nPreviously, when we interpreted a regression table, like the one shown in Table 4, we focused entirely on the term and estimate columns. Let’s now shift our attention to the remaining columns: std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Regression table for estimated coefficients from regression on birth weight and mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd_error\nstatistic\np_value\nlower_ci\nupper_ci\n\n\n\n\nintercept\n6.793\n0.208\n32.651\n0.000\n6.385\n7.201\n\n\nmage\n0.014\n0.007\n1.987\n0.047\n0.000\n0.028\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR, the programming language has been around since roughly 1997, a period when computers were not able to run the simulations we can today. Thus, the calculations R provides in the std_error, statistic, p_value, lower_ci and upper_ci columns are not found using simulation-based methods. Rather, R uses a theory-based approach using mathematical formulas. These formulas were derived in a time when computers didn’t exist, so it would’ve been incredibly labor intensive to run extensive simulations.\n\n6.1.1 Standard error\nThe third column of the regression table in Table 4, std_error, corresponds to the standard error of our estimates. Recall the definition of standard error we saw last week:\n\nThe standard error is the standard deviation of any point estimate computed from a sample.\n\nSo what does this mean in terms of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) = 0.014? This value is just one possible value of the fitted slope resulting from this particular sample of \\(n\\) = 1000 birth records. However, if we collected a different sample of \\(n\\) = 1000 birth records, we will almost certainly obtain a different fitted slope \\(b_1\\). This is due to sampling variability.\nSay we hypothetically collected 1000 such birth records, computed the 1000 resulting values of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\), and visualized them in a histogram. This would be a visualization of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\), which we defined last week. Further recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\) has a special name: the standard error.\nLast week, we used the infer package to construct the bootstrap distribution for \\(b_1\\) in this case. Recall that the bootstrap distribution is an approximation to the sampling distribution in that they have a similar shape. Since they have a similar shape, they have similar standard errors. However, unlike the sampling distribution, the bootstrap distribution is constructed from a single sample, which is a practice more aligned with what’s done in real life.\nRather than resampling from our original sample to create a bootstrap distribution, we could have instead used theory-based methods to estimated the standard error of the sampling distribution. In particular, there is a formula for the standard error of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\):\n\\[\\text{SE}_{b_1} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{s_y}{s_x} \\cdot \\sqrt{1-r^2}}{\\sqrt{n-2}}\\]\nAs with many formulas in statistics, there’s a lot going on here, so let’s first break down what each symbol represents. First \\(s_x\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable mage and the response variable weight, respectively. Second, \\(r\\) is the sample correlation coefficient between mage and weight. This was computed as 0.063. Lastly, \\(n\\) is the number of pairs of points (birth weight, mother’s age) in the births14 data frame, here 1000.\nTo put this formula into words, the standard error of \\(b_1\\) depends on the relationship between the variability of the response variable and the variability of the explanatory variable as measured in the \\(s_y / s_x\\) term. Next, it looks into how the two variables relate to each other in the \\(\\sqrt{1-r^2}\\) term.\nHowever, the most important observation to make in the previous formula is that there is an \\(n - 2\\) in the denominator. In other words, as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\) decreases. Just as we demonstrated last week, when we increase our sample size the amount of sampling variation of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) will depend on the sample size \\(n\\). In particular, as the sample size increases, both the sampling and bootstrap distributions narrow and the standard error \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\) decreases. Hence, our estimates of \\(b_1\\) for the true population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) get more and more precise.\n\n\n6.1.2 Test statistic\nThe fourth column of the regression table in Table 4, statistic, corresponds to a test statistic relating to the following hypothesis test:\n\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\)\n\nHere, our null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) assumes that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0. If the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is truly 0, then this is saying that there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age for all births in the US in 2014. In other words, \\(x\\) = mother’s age would have no associated effect on \\(y\\) = baby’s birth weight.\nThe alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\), on the other hand, assumes that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is not 0, meaning it could be either positive or negative. This suggests either a positive or negative relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age. Recall we called such alternative hypotheses two-sided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBy convention, all hypothesis testing for regression assumes two-sided alternatives.\n\n\nThe statistic column in the regression table is a tricky one, however. It corresponds to a standardized t-test statistic. The null distribution can be mathematically proven to be a \\(t\\)-distribution, under specific conditions (described in Section 7). R uses the following \\(t\\)-statistic as the test statistic for hypothesis testing:\n\\[\nt = \\dfrac{ b_1 - \\beta_1}{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}}\n\\]\nAnd since the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) is assumed during the hypothesis test, the \\(t\\)-statistic becomes\n\\[\nt = \\dfrac{ b_1 - 0}{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}} = \\dfrac{ b_1 }{ \\text{SE}_{b_1}}\n\\]\nWhat are the values of \\(b_1\\) and \\(\\text{SE}_{b_1}\\)? They are in the estimate and std_error column of the regression table in Table 4. Thus the value of 1.987 in the table is computed as 0.014 / 0.007 = 2. Note there is a difference due to some rounding error here.\n\n\n6.1.3 p-value\nThe fifth column of the regression table in Table 4, p_value, corresponds to the p-value of the hypothesis test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\).\nAgain recalling our terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis tests we introduced in Section 2, let’s focus on the definition of the \\(p\\)-value:\n\nA p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.\n\nRecall that you can intuitively think of the \\(p\\)-value as quantifying how “extreme” the observed fitted slope of \\(b_1\\) = 0.014 is in a “hypothesized universe” where there is no relationship between a baby’s birth weight and a mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you’re a bit rusty on the \\(t\\)-distribution, here is an article describing how degrees of freedom relate to the shape of the \\(t\\)-distribution.\n\n\nMore precisely, however, the \\(p\\)-value corresponds to how extreme the observed test statistic of 0.014 is when compared to the appropriate null distribution. Recall from Section 2, that a null distribution is the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. It can be mathematically proven that a \\(t\\)-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(df = n - 2 = 1000 - 2 = 998\\) is a reasonable approximation to the null distribution, if certain conditions for inference are not violated. We will discuss these conditions shortly in Section 7.\n\n\n6.1.4 Confidence interval\nThe two rightmost columns of the regression table in Table 4, lower_ci and upper_ci, correspond to the endpoints of the 95% confidence interval for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\). What are the calculations that went into computing the two endpoints of the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\)?\nRecall from the SE method for constructing confidence intervals, for any distribution that resemble a Normal Distribution2, we could use the empiracle rule to create a 95% confidence interval:\n\n\\(b_1 \\pm SE_{b_1} \\times\\) 1.96\n\n\nWhat is the value of the standard error \\(SE_{b_1}\\)? It is in fact in the third column of the regression table in Table 4: 0.007. Plugging in the respective values, we have:\n\n0.014 \\(\\pm\\) 0.007 \\(\\times\\) 1.96\n0.014 \\(\\pm\\) 0.01372\n(0.00028, 0.02772)\n\n\nThis closely matches the \\((0,0.028)\\) confidence interval in the last two columns of Table 4, with slight differences due to rounding.\nMuch like p-values, the results of this confidence interval also are only valid if the conditions for inference are not violated."

There is a lot of background theory to understand before you can fully make sense of the equations for theory-based methods. That being said, theory-based methods and simulation-based methods for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests often yield consistent results. As mentioned before, in my opinion, two large benefits of simulation-based methods over theory-based are that (1) they are easier for people new to statistical inference to understand, and (2) they also work in situations where theory-based methods and mathematical formulas don’t exist."

Recall the scatterplot in Figure 1 where we had the explanatory variable \\(x\\) as mother’s age and the outcome variable \\(y\\) as baby’s birth weight. Would you say that the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is linear? It’s hard to say because of the scatter of the points about the line. In my opinion, this relationship is “linear enough.”\nLet’s present an example where the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is clearly not linear in Figure 15. In this case, the points clearly follow a curved relationship, more closely resembling a logarithmic scale. In this case, any results from an inference for regression would not be valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Example of a clearly non-linear relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Independence of residuals\nThe second condition is that the residuals must be Independent. In other words, the different observations in our data must be independent of one another.\nFor the evals dataset, while there is data on 463 courses, these 463 courses were actually taught by 94 unique instructors. In other words, the same professor is often included more than once in our data. For a professor in the evals data who taught multiple classes, it seems reasonable to expect that their teaching scores will be related to each other. If a professor gets a high score in one class, chances are fairly good they’ll get a high score in another. This dataset thus provides different information than if we had 463 unique instructors teaching the 463 courses.\nIn this case, we say there exists dependence between observations. So in this case, the independence condition is violated. The most appropriate analysis would take into account that we have repeated measures for the same profs, but that is beyond the scope of this class. What we could do, however, is devise a method to collapse the multiple observations for each professor into one observation. This could be done a variety of ways:\n\nrandomly selecting one observation per professor\ntaking the mean of their scores3\nselecting the maximum / minimum / median value\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Normality of residuals\nThe third condition is that the residuals should follow a Normal distribution. Furthermore, the center of this distribution should be 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make positive errors: \\(y - \\widehat{y} &gt; 0\\). Other times, the regression model will make equally negative errors: \\(y - \\widehat{y} &lt; 0\\). However, on average the errors should equal 0 and their shape should be similar to that of a bell.\nThe simplest way to check the normality of the residuals is to look at a histogram, which we visualize in Figure 16.\n\nregression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(births_lm)\n\nggplot(data = regression_points, \n       mapping = aes(x = residual)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Residual\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Histogram of residuals from regression model for baby birth weight as predicted by mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram shows that we have more negative residuals than negative. Since the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) is negative when \\(y &lt; \\widehat{y}\\), it seems our regression model’s fitted baby birth weights (\\(\\widehat{y}\\)) tend to overestimate the birth weight \\(y\\). Furthermore, this histogram has a left-skew in that there is a longer tail on the left. This is another way to say the residuals exhibit a negative skew.\nIs this a problem? Again, there is a certain amount of subjectivity in the response. In my opinion, while there is a slight skew to the residuals, I don’t believe it is so bad that I would say this condition is violated. On the other hand, others might disagree with our assessment.\nLet’s present examples where the residuals clearly do and don’t follow a normal distribution in Figure 17. In this case of the model yielding the clearly non-normal residuals on the right, any results from an inference for regression would not be valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Example of clearly normal and clearly not normal residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.5 Equality of variance\nThe fourth and final condition is that the residuals should exhibit Equal variance across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). In other words, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of the explanatory variable \\(x\\).\nRecall the scatterplot in Figure 1: we had the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of mother’s age on the x-axis and the outcome variable \\(y\\) of baby’s birth weight on the y-axis. Instead, let’s create a scatterplot that has the same values on the x-axis, but now with the residual \\(y-\\widehat{y}\\) on the y-axis as seen in Figure 18.\n\nggplot(data = regression_points, \n       mapping = aes(x = mage, y = residual)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Mother's Age\", y = \"Residual\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = \"blue\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Plot of residuals over mother’s age.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can think of Figure 18 a modified version of the plot with the regression line in Figure 1, but with the regression line flattened out to \\(y=0\\). Looking at this plot, would you say that the spread of the residuals around the line at \\(y=0\\) is constant across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of mother’s age? This question is rather qualitative and subjective in nature, thus different people may respond with different answers. For example, some people might say that there is slightly more variation in the residuals for ages between 20 and 40 than for ages below 20 and above 40. However, it can be argued that there isn’t a drastic non-constancy. Moreover, this could be an artifact of having smaller numbers of younger / older mothers in the sample.\nIn Figure 19 I present an example where the residuals clearly do not have equal variance across all values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Example of clearly non-equal variance.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the spread of the residuals increases as the value of \\(x\\) increases. This is a situation known as heteroskedasticity. Any inference for regression based on a model yielding such a pattern in the residuals would not be valid.\n\n\n7.1.6 What’s the conclusion?\nLet’s list our four conditions for inference for regression again and indicate whether or not they were violated in our analysis:\n\nLinearity of relationship between variables: No\nIndependence of residuals: No\nNormality of residuals: Slight left-skew, but not too concerning\nEquality of variance: No\n\nSo what does this mean for the results of our confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in Section 4? Since none of the conditions were viola ted, we can have faith in the confidence intervals and \\(p\\)-values calculated before. If, however, any of these conditions were violated, we would need to pause and reconsider our model.\nWhen the Independence condition is violated, there exist dependencies between the observations in the dataset. To remedy this, you will need to use a statistical model which accounts for this dependency structure. One such technique is called hierarchical/multilevel modeling, which you may learn about in more advanced statistics courses.\nWhen conditions L, N, E are violated, it often means there is a shortcoming in our model. For example, it may be the case that using only a single explanatory variable is insufficient. We may need to incorporate more explanatory variables in a multiple regression model as we did in previously, or perhaps use a transformation of one or more of your variables, or use an entirely different modeling technique. To learn more about addressing such shortcomings, you’ll have to take a class on or read up on more advanced regression modeling methods.\nThe conditions for inference in regression problems are a key part of regression analysis that are of vital importance to the processes of constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. However, it is often the case with regression analysis in the real world that some of these conditions may be violated. Furthermore, as you saw, there is a level of subjectivity in the residual analyses to verify the L, N, and E conditions. So what can you do? As a statistics educator, I advocate for transparency in communicating all results. This lets the stakeholders of any analysis know about a model’s shortcomings or whether the model is “good enough.” So while this checking of assumptions has lead to some fuzzy “it depends” results, we decided as authors to show you these scenarios to help prepare you for difficult statistical decisions you may need to make down the road."
